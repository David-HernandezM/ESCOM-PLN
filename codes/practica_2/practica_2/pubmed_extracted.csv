10.1111/ppe.12615,Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?,"Masarwa R, Platt RW, Filion KB","BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,01/05/2020

We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells(3). Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)(4) as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1.",Nature,24/09/2025

Here we show that ischaemic injury induces persistent microglial activation that perpetuates chronic inflammation, leading to microglial cholesterol accumulation and metabolic reprogramming. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct stroke-associated foamy microglia clusters characterized by extensive reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, direct intracerebral free cholesterol or cholesterol crystal infusion recapitulated sustained microglial activation, directly linking aberrant cholesterol metabolism to prolonged neuroinflammatory responses. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that reducing microglial cholesterol overload through genetic or pharmacological activation of CYP46A1 in male mice promotes white matter repair and functional recovery. These findings highlight microglial cholesterol metabolism as a key driver of post-stroke inflammation, offering therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol metabolism to mitigate long-term brain damage and promote neurorestoration, potentially improving stroke-related disability outcomes.",Nature metabolism,23/09/2025
10.1186/s12933-025-02921-3,Association of the triglyceride-glucose index combined with a body shape index with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stage 0-3: findings from two prospective cohorts.,"Chen M, Guo J, Shangguan Y, Sun Z, He X, Tu Q, Yan Q","BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a measure of insulin resistance, has been confirmed to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The new composite indicator, TyG-A body type index (TyG-ABSI), by integrating the TyG index and the A body type index, has demonstrated superior efficacy in predicting the risk of cardiovascular death in the general population compared to traditional indicators. This study aims to deeply explore the association between TyG-ABSI and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in the population with cardiovascular kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) stages 0-3. The analysis will be conducted from multiple dimensions such as the intensity of indicator correlation and potential influencing mechanisms, in order to comprehensively reveal the relationship between the two. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 13,480 participants in the NHANES cohort (1999-2018) using Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline functions. The results indicated that elevated TyG-ABSI values were independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.104-1.361) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.377, 95% CI 1.149-1.651). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and concordance index evaluations demonstrated that TyG-ABSI yielded more accurate long-term prognostic performance than other TyG-derived metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) of this indicator reached 0.688-0.708 in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk over 5-15 years, and 0.696-0.739 in the prediction of cardiovascular mortality risk. External validation using CHARLS data confirmed the robustness of these findings in predicting all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with CKM stages 0-3, TyG-ABSI demonstrates a stronger association with mortality risk and superior predictive ability compared with other TyG-derived metrics. Its performance suggests a potential role in capturing variations across diverse clinical subgroups, and informing optimal timing for preventive interventions.",Cardiovascular diabetology,23/09/2025

The new 2024 McDonald criteria provide a unified approach for diagnosing multiple sclerosis in individuals with relapsing or progressive courses throughout the lifespan (ie, from paediatric to late-life presentations). The optic nerve can now serve as a fifth anatomical location within the CNS for diagnosis. The central vein sign, paramagnetic rim lesions, and kappa free-light chain concentrations in CSF can be used, when available, to provide supportive evidence and confer specificity for a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in specific situations. In certain cases, radiologically isolated syndrome or neurological symptoms that do not constitute a clear attack or progression of disability can fulfil the criteria for a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. We also provide guidance for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older individuals (≥50 years) and those with comorbidities.

10.3390/ijms21030969,Precision Psychiatry Applications with Pharmacogenomics: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Approaches.,"Lin E, Lin CH, Lane HY","A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and pharmacogenomics studies.

10.1177/1060028015606469,Association Between Prenatal Acetaminophen Exposure and Future Risk of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children.,"Hoover RM, Hayes VA, Erramouspe J","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,01/12/2015
10.1007/s10549-022-06562-y,The feasibility of using an autologous GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine to induce immunity in patients with stage II-III and metastatic breast cancers.,"Anderson KS, Erick TK, Chen M, Daley H, Campbell M, Colson Y, Mihm M, Zakka LR, Hopper M, Barry W, Winer EP, Dranoff G, Overmoyer B","PURPOSE: The antigenic targets of immunity and the role of vaccination in breast cancer are unknown. We performed a phase I study of an autologous GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine in patients with metastatic and stage II-III breast cancer. METHODS: Tumor cells from patients with metastatic (n = 15) and stage II-III (n = 7) disease were transduced with a replication-defective adenoviral vector encoding GM-CSF, and then irradiated. Twelve and seven patients with metastatic and stage II-III disease, respectively, received weekly vaccination for three weeks, followed by every other week until disease progression or vaccine supply was exhausted (metastatic) or until six total vaccine doses were administered (stage II-III). RESULTS: Among those patients with metastatic disease who received vaccinations, eight had progressive disease at two months, three had stable disease for 4-13 months, and one has had no evidence of disease for 13 years. Of the patients with stage II-III disease, five died of metastatic disease between 1.16 and 8.49 years after the start of vaccinations (median 6.24 years) and two are alive as of September 2021. Toxicities included injection site reactions, fatigue, fever, upper respiratory symptoms, joint pain, nausea, and edema. Four of five evaluable patients with metastatic disease developed a skin reaction with immune cell infiltration after the fifth injection of unmodified, irradiated tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that tumor cells can be harvested from patients with metastatic or stage II-III breast cancer to prepare autologous GM-CSF-secreting vaccines that induce coordinated immune responses with limited toxicity.

Here, we developed a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) immunotherapy cohort (N = 27) and a spatial transcriptomics cohort (N = 88) to elucidate metabolic crosstalk associated with therapeutic efficacy in TNBC. We illustrated that heme binding protein 2 (HEBP2)(high) tumor cells (featured by active glutathione metabolism) and CCL3(+) macrophages (characterized by oxidative metabolism) indicated immunotherapy efficacy and were quantitatively and spatially negatively correlated. HEBP2-mediated glutamine face-off between these cell types induced this phenomenon. Mechanistically, HEBP2 disrupted FOXA1 cytoplasmic phase separation, promoting its nuclear translocation to upregulate glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) expression and glutamine consumption in tumor cells. This metabolic shift induced ferroptosis of CCL3(+) macrophages, impairing the antitumor immunity. The utilization of a GSTP1 inhibitor sensitized TNBC to immunotherapy. Collectively, we delineate a tumor-macrophage metabolic checkpoint governed by the HEBP2/GSTP1 axis and pioneer single-cell-level immunometabolism as a paradigm for evaluating immunotherapeutic vulnerabilities.",Cell metabolism,23/09/2025

Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p < 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p < 0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p < 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.",European journal of applied physiology,01/02/2011

However, this association has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health disorders.

In treatment-refractory SLE, we show that peripheral CD19(⁺) B cells and bone marrow CD19⁻BCMA⁺ long-lived plasma cells are dominant autoantibody sources, motivating dual CD19 and BCMA targeting. Here we report results from a cohort of patients (14 female, one male) in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation trial of co-infused autologous anti-CD19 and anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells after fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. Primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within 28 days and adverse events within 12 weeks; key secondary endpoints comprised attainment of Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) and DORIS remission within 12 weeks and in vivo CAR-T persistence within 24 weeks. Exploratory endpoints were the duration of post-infusion B cell depletion and time to recovery, the kinetics of immune reconstitution and longitudinal changes in autoantibody titers and serum immunoglobulin concentrations after CAR-T therapy. Over a median 712-day follow-up (range, 613-1,134), no DLTs occurred. Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome developed in 86.7% of patients, with no neurotoxicity or treatment-related deaths. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (100%), thrombocytopenia (40%) and anemia (13.3%), all of which were reversible with supportive care. By week 12, 12 of 15 patients (80%) fulfilled both the LLDAS and DORIS remission criteria. Multiomic analyses confirmed elimination of autoreactive CD19⁺BCMA⁺ clones, reconstitution of naive IgM/IgD B cells and durable downregulation of interferon-stimulated and BAFF-dependent signatures, indicating improved immune homeostasis. Longitudinal monitoring of three patients for 1 year demonstrated sustained eradication of pathogenic clones, suggesting potential cure. Dual anti-CD19/anti-BCMA CAR-T cell therapy demonstrates good safety and promising clinical efficacy in treatment-refractory SLE.

Moreover, 30-50% of patients still derive no therapeutic benefit from the combination strategy, highlighting the need to decipher and overcome resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which chemotherapy augments the responses to immune checkpoint blockade and elucidate the factors contributing to persistent resistance in non-responding patients. DESIGN: We designed a systematic investigation involving longitudinal sampling of ESCC tissues both from patients treated with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The tumour microenvironment (TME) was then comprehensively characterised using single-cell transcriptomics, T cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex immunohistochemistry and murine models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that combination therapy exerted superior antitumour efficacy by mitigating immune checkpoint engagements (TIGIT-NECTIN2 and NECTIN1-CD96) between epithelial-stress tumour cells and CD8(+) T cells, thereby preventing T cells from exhaustion and boosting vitality. In non-responders, we identified a subset of tumour cells with high SLC1A3 expression, which localised at the tumour boundary and interacted with COL1A1(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, inducing an extracellular matrix-enriched TME that hindered the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells. Inhibiting SLC1A3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the synergistic mechanisms and identifies key resistance pathways underlying chemo-immunotherapy combinations in patients with ESCC, providing a scientific basis for refining future combination therapeutic regimens.",Gut,22/09/2025

Recent studies have revealed that lactate-mediated histone lactylation, which functions as a novel epigenetic modification, is involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes-related complications. However, little is known about the role of lactyltransferase in DN. Alanyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) was identified as a novel lactyltransferase that modulates histone H3-lysine-18 lactylation (H3K18la). In the present study, we determined whether AARS1-mediated H3K18la participates in the pathogenesis of DN. More importantly, we explored the potential mechanism involved. A mouse DN model consisting of both wild-type and alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS1) heterozygote (AARS1(+/-)) mice was utilized in this study. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses, combined with a variety of molecular biological methodologies, were employed to elucidate the potential mechanism by which AARS1 regulates ferroptosis in DN. Our results indicated that the increases in AARS1 and H3K18la expression were involved in kidney dysfunction and renal cell death via the modulation of ferroptosis in the DN model. Moreover, AARS1 induced lipid peroxidation by increasing fatty acid elongase-5 (ELOVL5) transcription, ultimately contributing to ferroptosis induction. Furthermore, AARS1 interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) to jointly regulate ELOVL5 transcription. Additionally, treatment with the STAT1-specific inhibitor fludarabine delayed DN progression. In addition, we observed that AARS1 modulated the lactylation of both STAT1 and H3K18 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis. Inhibition of AARS1-induced lactylation via β-alanine attenuated ferroptosis in DN model mice and hyperglycaemic cells. The present study showed that AARS1 induced the lactylation of H3K18 and STAT1 to regulate ELOVL5 transcription, thus triggering ferroptosis in a diabetic nephropathy model.",Cell death and differentiation,23/09/2025

Nasal microbiome analyses revealed a positive correlation between depression scores and S. aureus abundance among patients with depression and healthy controls. Metabolomics of the nasal cavity showed decreased sex hormones, estradiol and testosterone in patients with depression versus controls. Nasal microbiota transplants from patients reproduced depression-like behaviour in mice with differential abundance of S. aureus. Further homology and mutational analysis uncovered an S. aureus sex hormone-degrading enzyme, 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd12), which degraded testosterone and estradiol in mice, leading to lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the murine brain.

Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,23/09/2025

Rat AD models were established by an operation (OP) in which rats were treated with a one-time intra-cerebroventricuIar injection of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) and continuous gavage of aluminum chloride every day for 4 weeks. GRE was administered intra-gastrically to rats. After 35 days, learning and memory were assessed in all of the rats. Brain sections were processed for immunohistochemistry and Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) and Nissl staining. The latency to show significant memory deficits was shorter in the group that received OP with a high dose of GRE (HG)(OP+HG) than in the groups that received OP with a low or moderate dose of GRE (LG, MG)(OP+LG, OP+MG) (p<0.05).

Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS-STING signalling(3). However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME1(4), in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS-STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.",Nature,24/09/2025

By characterizing key molecular, cellular and niche events at the precancerous tipping point of early gastric cancer (EGC), we aimed to develop more precise screening tools and design targeted interventions to prevent malignant transformation at this stage. We utilized our AI models to integrate spatial multimodal data from nine EGC endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) samples (covering sequential stages from normal to cancer), construct a spatial-temporal profile of disease progression, and identify a critical tipping point (PMC_P) characterized by an immune-suppressive microenvironment during early cancer development. At this stage, inflammatory pit mucous cells with stemness (PMC_2) interact with fibroblasts via NAMPT ⟶ ITGA5/ITGB1 and with macrophages via AREG ⟶ EGFR/ERBB2 signaling, fostering cancer initiation. We established gastric precancerous cell lines and organoids to demonstrate that NAMPT and AREG promote cellular proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, in the transgenic CEA-SV40 mouse model, targeting AREG and/or NAMPT disrupted key cell interactions, inhibited the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways, and reduced PD-L1 expression, which was also confirmed by western blot in vitro. These interventions delayed disease progression, reversed the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and prevented malignant transformation. Clinical validation was conducted using endoscopically resected EGC specimens. Our study provides a precise spatiotemporal depiction of EGC development and identifies novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for early intervention.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,22/09/2025

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as first-line therapies for advanced HCC, substantially improving clinical outcomes. However, resistance to ICIs remains a major therapeutic challenge. Lactylation, a recently identified post-translational modification, has been implicated in tumor progression, although its role in ICIs resistance in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: Cytotoxicity assays, flow cytometry and orthotopic HCC mouse model were used to evaluate the effects of lactylation in remodeling the immune microenvironment. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing were employed to identify lactylation-regulated gene profiles. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein degradation was assayed by cycloheximide-chase analysis and ubiquitination assay. Interactions between major vault protein (MVP) and β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis and truncation mutants were designed to determine binding sites of MVP-β-TrCP complex. RESULTS: Elevated lactylation correlates with poor prognosis and ICIs resistance in patients with HCC. Inhibition of lactylation enhances CD8(+) T-cell infiltration and cytokine production. Multiomics analyses identify MVP as a lactylation-regulated factor that suppresses CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Elevated MVP expression is associated with resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy. Mechanistic studies reveal that histone lactylation-induced MVP upregulation stabilizes PD-L1 by preventing β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of lactylation restores ICIs sensitivity in orthotopic HCC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that histone lactylation promotes ICIs resistance via MVP-dependent PD-L1 stabilization. Therefore, targeting lactylation in combination with programmed cell death protein-1/PD-L1 blockade offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance in HCC.",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,21/09/2025

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: Data sourced from public databases were harnessed to predict the targets of PET-MPs and identify UC-related differentially expressed genes. Functional enrichment analyses were conducted to uncover relevant biological pathways. Three machine learning algorithms were utilized to screen for hub genes associated with PET-MPs-induced UC, followed by the evaluation of these hub genes using eight machine learning algorithms via SHAP analysis. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed and validated based on a Risk prediction model, and single-cell sequencing analysis and molecular docking were performed. An animal model was established via co-administration of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and PET-MPs. Western blot analysis was employed to verify the protein expression levels in intestinal tissues. RESULTS: Eleven potential targets related to PET-MPs-induced UC toxicity were identified. Four hub genes (CTSK, NAAA, PDE4B, and PFKFB3) were successfully screened out, exhibiting significant expression disparities in UC samples. The constructed Risk prediction model demonstrated high prediction accuracy. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of the hub genes across different cell types, and molecular docking confirmed strong binding affinities between PET-MPs and these genes. Animal experiments revealed that the expression levels of CTSK, PDE4B, and PFKFB3 in the DSS + PET-MPs group were significantly upregulated, while the expression level of NAAA was significantly downregulated, compared with the DSS group. CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which PET-MPs may induce UC, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the potential health risks associated with PET-MPs exposure.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",22/09/2025

We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival.

The effectiveness of current therapies for advanced cases is hindered by intricate genetic and microenvironmental factors, emphasizing the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Chimeric RNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers in cancer research, among which CCDC7(19-13), a circular chimeric RNA, is frequently identified in prostate cancer. Our study reveals that CCDC7(19-13) expression is markedly reduced in advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, where its low levels serve as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Functional experiments demonstrate that CCDC7(19-13) overexpression inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and suppresses tumor growth in vivo, whereas its knockdown reverses these effects. Mechanistically, CCDC7(19-13) encodes a novel protein, CCDC7(241aa), which triggers ferroptosis by interacting with SLC7A11 and facilitating its TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Notably, treatment with recombinant CCDC7(241aa) effectively suppresses tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft models without toxicity and enhances the efficacy of docetaxel and enzalutamide in vitro.

Impaired shear stress signalling contributes to endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Heart development protein with EGF-like domain 1 (HEG1), a flow-sensitive, endothelial-derived protein, is inversely associated with cardiovascular risks. This study aimed to elucidate the role of endothelial HEG1 in BP regulation and the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Phenome-wide association study, computational fluid dynamics analysis, single-cell RNA sequencing, artery and plasma samples from independent cohorts, and in vitro shear stress analysis were used to assess the association between hypertension, shear stress, and HEG1 levels. Endothelial-specific Heg1 deletion mice, BP monitoring, and vascular function analysis were employed to characterize the roles of EC-HEG1 in endothelial function and hypertension. Proteomics, transcriptomics, and ubiquitination assays were used to identify the regulatory pathways involved. RESULTS: Plasma HEG1 levels were down-regulated in hypertensive subjects due to reduced wall shear stress on the endothelium, which diminished HEG1 expression and its release into circulation. Endothelial-specific Heg1 deletion in mice resulted in elevated BP, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and hypertensive levels especially in an ApoeKO dyslipidaemia background. Mechanistically, HEG1 facilitated CUL3-mediated degradation of PHACTR1. HEG1 deletion led to increased PHACTR1 levels, nuclear translocation, and suppression of SP1-mediated eNOS transcription and NO production. Inhibition of PHACTR1 nuclear localization by CCG-1423 prevented impaired vasodilation and hypertension.

Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis(3,4). Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity(5). Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.",Nature,24/09/2025

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and severity and whether this association is mediated by changes in the gut microbiota, particularly Eggerthella and Hungatella abundance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was conducted in Germany using cross-sectional data from the Marburg-Münster Affective Cohort. Patients with MDD and healthy controls (aged 18-65 years) recruited from the general population and primary care between September 2014 and September 2018 were analyzed. Data analyses were conducted between May and December 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary analyses included multivariable regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models examining the association between soft drink consumption and MDD diagnosis and symptom severity, controlling for site and education, and Eggerthella and Hungatella abundance, controlling for site, education, and library size. Mediation analyses tested whether microbiota abundance mediated the soft drink-MDD link. RESULTS: A total of 405 patients with MDD (275 female patients [67.9%]; mean [SD] age, 36.37 [13.33] years) and 527 healthy controls (345 female controls [65.5%]; mean [SD] age, 35.33 [13.13] years) were included. Soft drink consumption predicted MDD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 1.081; 95% CI, 1.008-1.159; P = .03) and symptom severity (P < .001; partial η2 [ηp2], 0.012; 95% CI, 0.004-0.035), with stronger effects in women (diagnosis: OR, 1.167; 95% CI, 1.054-1.292; P = .003; severity: P < .001; ηp2, 0.036; 95% CI, 0.011-0.062). In women, consumption was linked to increased Eggerthella (P = .007; ηp2, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.0002-0.068), but not Hungatella abundance. Mediation analyses confirmed that Eggerthella significantly mediated the soft drink-MDD association (diagnosis: P = .011; severity: P = .005), explaining 3.82% and 5.00% of the effect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, it was found that soft drink consumption may contribute to MDD through gut microbiota alterations, notably involving Eggerthella. Public health strategies to reduce soft drink intake may help mitigate depression risk, especially among vulnerable populations; in addition, interventions for depression targeting the microbiome composition appear promising.",JAMA psychiatry,24/09/2025

We demonstrate that the specific RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit RPB9 directly interacts with the 3' AG dinucleotide binding factor U2AF1 to initiate 3' splice site recognition. Combined with recent structural insights into Pol II-mediated 5' splice site selection, these findings support a cotranscriptional mechanism to recognize paired 3' and 5' splice sites across individual exons. These initial exon definition events facilitate the recruitment of U2AF2 to heterodimerize with U2AF1, which also triggers U2AF1 release from elongating Pol II.

MEN1 gene encodes menin-oncosuppressor protein. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q13 is typical of MEN1 tumors. We have analyzed the MEN1 mRNA and menin expression in fibroblasts from normal skin biopsies and from MEN1 patients (two with a frameshift 738del4 (exon 3) mutation, introducing a premature stop codon, and an individual with an R460X (exon 10) nonsense mutation). The expression of full-length menin protein did not differ between MEN1 and normal fibroblasts. Wild-type alleles mRNAs were expressed in MEN1 patients, whereas mutant alleles were partially degraded by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, suggesting a mechanism of compensation for allelic loss by the up-regulation of wild-type menin expression at a post-transcriptional level. Small-interfering RNA silencing of the wild-type mRNA allele abolished menin compensation, whereas the ribozyme silencing of the MEN1-mutated mRNA allele resulted in strongly enhanced wild-type menin expression.

This study assessed the effects of long-term anti-Aβ antibodies on amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and CSF tau species to determine the relationships between them. METHODS: A post-hoc analysis of the DIAN-TU-001 trial (NCT01760005) examined 142 participants at risk for dominantly inherited AD randomized to solanezumab (n = 50), gantenerumab (n = 52), or placebo (n = 40). High-resolution mass spectrometry quantified CSF tau species over four years. RESULTS: Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species (153, 181, 217, 231) increased early in preclinical AD but were reduced with gantenerumab-mediated Aβ plaque reduction. Nearly a decade later, MTBR-tau243 and p-tau205 increased, showing no association with Aβ reduction, aligning with tau tangle pathology progression. DISCUSSION: Initially changing soluble p-tau species track Aβ plaque reduction, while ptau205 and MTBR-243 reflect tau tangle pathology, informing different pathways of therapeutic strategies. HIGHLIGHTS: p-tau217 and p-tau231 correlate with Aβ-PET and respond to Aβ-plaque lowering therapies. Aβ immunotherapy trials support a direct link between p-tau changes and Aβ plaques Gantenerumab reduces Aβ plaques but does not affect tau NFT-related biomarkers.

Our analysis demonstrates that GZMB(+)GNLY(+) CD8(+) T cells are the main expanded subset across different autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SjD pathogenesis, while the enrichment of memory B cells is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial profiling reveals THY1(+) fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands. These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of SjD, and may inform the development of targeted and personalized therapeutic strategies.",Nature communications,22/09/2025
10.1371/journal.pmed.1004722,Association between lower fasting plasma glucose levels during oral glucose tolerance test and adverse perinatal outcomes: A Chinese cohort study.,"Wang L, Tang C, Cheng M, Hao Y, Chen S, Zhang S, Zhang C, Mol BW, Wu Y, Huang H","BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level within the normal range as defined by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria is associated with perinatal outcomes. This study explored the associations between FPG levels lower than the IADPSG threshold during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and adverse perinatal outcomes in women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS AND FINDINGS: From January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2022, this single-center retrospective cohort study included 33,417 women with singleton pregnancies at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. All women underwent a 75-g OGTT at 24-28 gestational weeks. The primary endpoint was a composite of adverse outcomes, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, fetal death and stillbirth, preterm birth, primary cesarean delivery, and small or large for gestational age. Overall, 3,108 (9.5%) women had IADPSG-defined GDM and of whom 2,426 (76.3%) had FPG levels below the IADPSG threshold. Compared to the GDM population, non-GDM women with borderline-normal FPG levels were at significantly greater risk of adverse outcomes with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.62 (95% CI [1.20, 2.19]; p = 0.002) at 4.6 mmol/L, an aOR of 1.50 (95% CI [1.05, 2.13]; p = 0.025) at 4.8 mmol/L, and an aOR of 1.58 (95% CI [1.05, 2.40]; p = 0.030) at 4.9 mmol/L glucose level. Nonetheless, non-GDM women demonstrated significantly lower risk (aOR 0.66, 95% CI [0.44, 0.98]; p = 0.038) compared to GDM counterparts exhibiting low fasting glycemia at 3.9 mmol/L. However, this study was limited by its retrospective design and may lack generalizability to other ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Even at FPG levels lower than the IADPSG threshold, FPG was significantly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, and the associations presented different patterns in women with and without GDM.",PLoS medicine,01/09/2025

Observational studies suggest that aspirin may also improve disease-free survival after diagnosis, particularly among patients with tumors harboring somatic PIK3CA mutations. However, data from randomized trials are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with stage I, II, or III rectal cancer or stage II or III colon cancer with somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes. The patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 160 mg of aspirin or matched placebo once daily for 3 years. Patients with prespecified PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 (group A alterations) and those with other moderate- or high-impact somatic variants in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, or PTEN (group B alterations) were eligible for randomization. The primary end point was colorectal cancer recurrence, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, in patients with group A alterations. Secondary end points included colorectal cancer recurrence in patients with group B alterations, disease-free survival, and safety. RESULTS: Alterations in PI3K pathway genes were detected in 1103 of 2980 patients (37.0%) with complete genomic data. Of 515 patients with group A alterations and 588 patients with group B alterations, 314 and 312, respectively, were assigned to receive aspirin or placebo. The estimated 3-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 7.7% with aspirin and 14.1% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24 to 0.98; P = 0.04) among patients with group A alterations and 7.7% and 16.8%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.83), among those with group B alterations. The estimated 3-year disease-free survival was 88.5% with aspirin and 81.4% with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.08) among patients with group A alterations and 89.1% and 78.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.88), among those with group B alterations. Severe adverse events occurred in 16.8% of aspirin recipients and 11.6% of placebo recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin led to a significantly lower incidence of colorectal cancer recurrence than placebo among patients with PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 or 20 and appeared to have a similar benefit among those with other somatic alterations in PI3K pathway genes.

Homeostatic and anticipatory signals converge in the subfornical organ (SFO); however, the neural pathways conveying peripheral information to the SFO before changes in blood composition are incompletely understood. Here we reveal an inhibitory pathway from the medial septum (MS) to the SFO that is involved in the control of anticipatory drinking behavior in mice. MS γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons encode water-satiation signals by integrating cues from the oral cavity and tracking gastrointestinal signals. These neurons receive inputs from the parabrachial nucleus and relay to SFO(CaMKII) neurons, forming a bottom-up pathway with activity that prevents overhydration. Disruption of this circuit leads to excessive water intake and hyponatremia. Our findings reveal a septal pathway that integrates multiple layers of presystemic signals to fine-tune drinking behavior.",Nature neuroscience,22/09/2025

This study performs a comprehensive evaluation from rodents to non-human primates (NHP) of a protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7)-targeted ApDC (Sgc8c-M) made by conjugating the potent antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to the classic PTK7 aptamer Sgc8c. Efficacy studies in various cancer types with PTK7 overexpression showed that Sgc8c-M effectively induces sustained tumor regression in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenografts, outperforming unconjugated MMAE, the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, and a PTK7-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice revealed that Sgc8c-M leads to rapid accumulation and sustained MMAE levels in tumors, along with fast clearance from plasma and normal tissues. Further study in rats confirmed rapid clearance across most organs and revealed that over 75% of MMAE was excreted through urine and feces within 24 h. Toxicokinetic (TK) assessments indicated comparable systemic drug exposure without accumulation for repeated doses compared to single administration. Toxicity evaluations showed that the therapeutic dose with high efficacy was safe and that the toxicity resulting from extremely high doses could be reversibly controlled. Encouraged by these findings, we evaluated PK/TK profiles and safety of Sgc8c-M in cynomolgus monkeys. Similar to PK/TK profiles observed in rats, Sgc8c-M demonstrated good dose-dependent drug exposure. It was, moreover, well tolerated in monkeys with no obvious accumulation following multiple administrations. These findings highlight the potential of Sgc8c-M as an effective antitumor agent and provide useful insights for the clinical translation of emerging ApDCs.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,24/09/2025

Still, many malignancies that lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically ""cold"" fail to respond to these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that turned these tumors ""hot"" and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with reduced STING expression, CD8(+) T cell numbers, overall survival, and immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Thus, PPT1 inhibition may be a promising approach to activate STING and potentiate the effects of immunotherapy in cold tumors.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

The cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid prostaglandin E2 and its receptor EP4 are crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis. This study aimed to determine the role of EP4 in the pathogenesis of PAH and evaluate the potential of EP4 as a therapeutic target for PAH. METHODS: Two well-established PAH models, the monocrotaline-induced rat model and hypoxia/Su5416-induced mouse model, were used in this study. Both pharmacological interventions (including the EP4 antagonist grapiprant and MF498 and the agonist Cay10598) and genetic strategies (including vascular smooth muscle cell [VSMC]-specific EP4 knockout mice and VSMC-specific human EP4 transgenic mice) were used to comprehensively investigate the role of EP4 in the pathogenesis of PAH. Multiple cellular and molecular biology approaches were employed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: The results showed that the pharmacological blockade of the EP4 receptor and genetic deletion of the EP4 gene in VSMCs led to a significant improvement in PAH and PA remodelling. Conversely, pharmacological activation and VSMC-specific overexpression of EP4 exacerbate PAH progression. Further analysis identified annexin A2 (ANXA2) as a critical downstream mediator in EP4-induced PAH progression. Mechanistically, EP4 activation was found to enhance the translation of ANXA2 and phosphorylation of ANXA2 at Thr208 via the cAMP/PKA pathway, promoting PASMC proliferation and migration through increased nuclear translocation of β-catenin, a key signalling molecule in the canonical Wnt pathway. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of ANXA2 effectively protected PAH in rodents, suggesting its pathogenic role in PAH development. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a crucial pathway involving EP4 and ANXA2 in PAH development and progression. Targeting EP4 and its downstream effector ANXA2 represents promising therapeutic strategies for PAH management.",European heart journal,25/09/2025

This review summarizes the recent data and the current hypotheses on mechanisms that may contribute to drug-resistant IGE. A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase for studies on mechanisms of drug resistance published since 1980. The literature shows neither consensus on the definition nor a widely accepted model to explain drug resistance in IGE or one of its subsyndromes. Large-scale genetic studies have failed to identify distinct genetic causes or affected genes involved in pharmacokinetics. We found clinical and experimental evidence in support of four hypotheses: (1) ""network hypothesis""-the degree of drug resistance in IGE reflects the severity of cortical network alterations, (2) ""minor focal lesion in a predisposed brain hypothesis""-minor cortical lesions are important for drug resistance, (3) ""interneuron hypothesis""-impaired functioning of γ-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons contributes to drug resistance, and (4) ""changes in drug kinetics""-genetically impaired kinetics of antiseizure medication (ASM) reduce the effectiveness of available ASMs. In summary, the exact definition and cause of drug resistance in IGE is unknown.

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the TyG and the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with normoglycemia, dysglycemia, and diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Participants from nine cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included and categorized into three groups: normoglycemia, dysglycemia, and diabetes. Cox regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were performed to evaluate the linear and nonlinear associations between TyG and mortality. To assess the predictive power of TyG and the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) for mortality, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, and blood pressure status. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.2 years, a total of 2199 all-cause deaths and 606 cardiovascular deaths were documented. In the normoglycemic group, a single standard unit increase in TyG was associated with a 35% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56; HR: 1.38, 95% CI 1.04-1.84, respectively). Among participants with diabetes, RCS analysis revealed a U-shaped association between TyG and all-cause/cardiovascular mortality, with an inflection point at 9.1. No significant associations were observed in the dysglycemia group. TyG demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to the AIP for 3-year mortality in both normoglycemic and diabetic individuals. Subgroup analyses identified significant interaction effects of age and sex on the association between TyG and mortality. CONCLUSION: TyG was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in the normoglycemic subgroup, but not in the dysglycemic subgroup. In the diabetes subgroup, the association between the TyG and mortality was nonlinear.

METHODS: The data of all the matches played during the ""Serie A"" 2017-2018 season were obtained from the Italian soccer league. The teams' analysis was performed in terms of total distance covered in km, jogging, running and sprint activities, average speed, and match statistics (total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, assists, turnovers, and steals). RESULTS: Teams that reached the first four positions revealed a lower percentage of running (65.98 ± 1.51 vs. 66.84 ± 2.18; p < 0.001), a higher percentage of jogging (25.61 ± 1.71 vs. 25.30 ± 1.97; p = 0.037) and sprint activities (8.41 ± 1.04 vs. 7.86 ± 0.82; p < 0.001). Match statistics seem to be statistically different between the first four teams the other teams. The total goals are strongly associated both with the total score at the end of the championship (R = 0.906; p < 0.001) and with the position in the final ranking (R = 0.850; p < 0.001).

Neuronal and glial cells have been implicated. It has a genetic component but can also be triggered by environmental factors or drugs. For example, prenatal exposure to valproic acid or acetaminophen, or ingestion of propionic acid, can increase the risk of ASD. Recently, epigenetic influences on ASD have come to the forefront of investigations on the etiology, prevention, and treatment of this disorder. Epigenetics refers to DNA modifications that alter gene expression without making any changes to the DNA sequence. Although an increasing number of pharmaceuticals and environmental chemicals are being implicated in the etiology of ASD, here, we specifically focus on the molecular influences of the abovementioned chemicals on epigenetic alterations in neuronal and glial cells and their potential connection to ASD. We conclude that a better understanding of these phenomena can lead to more effective interventions in ASD.",Biomolecules,03/04/2024

Furthermore, GCN2 deficiency increases HMOX1 and iron levels to facilitate ferroptosis in macrophages, and enhances arterial marker expression in venous endothelial cells (VECs). Specifically, spatial transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of NRP1, KDR and EFNB2 through ETS1 in VECs from PVOD patients. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting macrophage ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy for treating related vascular diseases, and of using NRP1/KDR/EFNB2 expression as a specific marker set for venous arterialization.",Nature communications,22/09/2025
10.4088/JCP.16f10721,Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the offspring.,Andrade C,"Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may result in compromised neurodevelopment through inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, through predisposition to oxidative stress, and through endocrine, endogenous cannabinoid, and other mechanisms. Several small and large prospective studies have found an association between gestational acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, use of ADHD medication, and ADHD diagnoses in offspring during childhood; the only negative study was a small investigation that examined only one aspect of attention as an outcome. Creditably, most of the studies adjusted analyses for many (but not all) confounds associated with ADHD risk. Importantly, one pivotal study also adjusted for pain, infection, inflammation, and fever to reduce confounding by indication; this study found a dose-dependent risk. In the light of the finding of a single study that infection and fever during pregnancy by themselves do not raise the ADHD risk, it appears possible that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is itself responsible for the increased risk of ADHD. This suggests that acetaminophen may not be as safe in pregnancy as is widely believed. However, since fever during pregnancy may itself be associated with adverse gestational outcomes, given the present level of uncertainty about the ADHD risk with acetaminophen, it is suggested that, until more data are available, the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy should not be denied in situations in which the need for the drug is clear.",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,01/03/2016

Levodopa is used in stroke rehabilitation despite mixed evidence for its effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether levodopa compared with placebo, administered in addition to standardized rehabilitation based on active task-oriented training, is associated with enhanced motor recovery in patients with acute stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial at 13 stroke units and centers and 11 collaborating rehabilitation centers in Switzerland. Between June 14, 2019 (first patient, first visit), and August 27, 2024 (last patient, last visit), 610 patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke with clinically meaningful hemiparesis (ie, a total score of ≥3 points on the following National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale items: motor arm, motor leg, or limb ataxia) were randomized 1:1 to receive levodopa or placebo. Statistical analyses were conducted from November 2024 to August 2025. INTERVENTION: Patients received levodopa/carbidopa (100 mg/25 mg; n = 307) or placebo (n = 303) 3 times daily for 39 days, alongside standardized rehabilitation therapy based on active task-oriented training. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the adjusted mean between-group difference in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) total score (range, 0-100 points; fewer points indicate worse motor function; 6-point difference considered patient-relevant) at 3 months. RESULTS: Among the 610 participants (median [IQR] age, 73 [64-82] years; 252 [41.3%] female; median baseline FMA total score, 34 [14-54]), 28 participants died by 3 months, leaving 582 (95.4%) participants eligible for the primary analysis. At 3 months, the median (IQR) FMA total score was 68 (42-85) points in the levodopa group and 64 (44-83) points in the placebo group. The mean difference in the FMA total score between the levodopa and placebo groups was -0.90 points (95% CI, -3.78 to 1.98; P = .54). There were 126 serious adverse events in the levodopa group and 129 in the placebo group; the most common was infection (levodopa, n = 55; placebo, n = 44). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, among patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation for acute stroke, levodopa added to standardized rehabilitation did not significantly improve motor function at 3 months compared with placebo plus standardized rehabilitation. These results do not support the use of levodopa as an adjunct to rehabilitation therapy for enhancing motor recovery after acute stroke.

DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: Stockholm, Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: 432 775 women who received invitations to the Swedish Mammography Screening Programme between 1991 and 2020 and were initially invited at either 50 years of age or 40 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening adherence, breast cancer incidence, tumour characteristics, and breast cancer mortality tracked through linkage to multiple Swedish national registers, with follow-up until 2023 (up to 25 year follow-up period). Cumulative breast cancer incidences were calculated from first screening participation. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios for breast cancer mortality; logistic regression models assessed associations with tumour characteristics by odds ratios. RESULTS: During a total of 4 940 375 person years of follow-up, 16 059 new cases of breast cancer were documented. Among women invited to their first mammography screening, 32.1% (n=138 760) did not participate. These non-participants were persistently less likely to attend subsequent screenings and were more likely have symptom detected, advanced stage breast cancer diagnosed. Specifically, compared with first screening participants, non-participants had an odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.88) for stage III cancer (160 (4.1%) v 266 (2.9%) cases) and 3.61 (2.79 to 4.68) for stage IV cancer (150 (3.9%) v 105 (1.2%) cases). During a total of 6 818 686 person years of follow-up, 1603 deaths from breast cancer were documented. Non-participation at first screening was also associated with significantly higher breast cancer mortality, with a 25 year cumulative mortality of 9.9 per 1000 versus 7.0 per 1000 for participants (adjusted hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.55). By contrast, the 25 year breast cancer incidence was similar between groups (7.8% in participants versus 7.6% in non-participants), suggesting that the elevated mortality among first screening non-participants likely reflects delayed detection rather than increased incidence. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that first screening non-participants represent a large population at long term risk of dying from breast cancer, providing an opportunity for targeted interventions to improve adherence to screening and thereby decrease mortality risk.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),24/09/2025

Using a strategy that regulates lifetime without affecting the spectra of FPs, we have developed a series of tr-FPs that cover the visible spectrum and a wide range of lifetimes. The tr-FPs are employed in temporal-spectral resolved microscopy, allowing for the simultaneous imaging of 9 different proteins in live cells and the correlation of multiple activities to cell cycles.

The present study compared different training regimes with respect to muscle strength, muscle fiber size, muscle architecture, and stair walking power in elderly postoperative patients. Thirty-six patients (60-86 yr) scheduled for unilateral hip replacement surgery due to hip osteoarthritis were randomized to either 1) resistance training (RT: 3/wk x 12 wk), 2) electrical stimulation (ES: 1 h/day x 12 wk), or 3) standard rehabilitation (SR: 1 h/day x 12 wk). All measurements were performed at baseline, at 5 wk and 12 wk postsurgery. After 12 wk of resistance training, maximal dynamic muscle strength increased by 30% at 60 degrees /s (P < 0.05) and by 29% at 180 degrees /s (P < 0.05); muscle fiber area increased for type I (+17%, P < 0.05), type IIa (+37%, P < 0.05), and type IIx muscle fibers (+51%, P < 0.05); and muscle fiber pennation angle increased by 22% and muscle thickness increased by 15% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, stair walking power increased by 35% (P < 0.05) and was related to the increase in type II fiber area (r = 0.729, P < 0.05). In contrast, there was no increase in any measurement outcomes with electrical stimulation and standard rehabilitation. The present study is the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of resistance training to induce beneficial qualitative changes in muscle fiber morphology and muscle architecture in elderly postoperative patients. In contrast, rehabilitation regimes based on functional exercises and neuromuscular electrical stimulation had no effect. The present data emphasize the importance of resistance training in future rehabilitation programs for elderly individuals.","Journal of applied physiology (Bethesda, Md. : 1985)",01/07/2008

The primary end point was safety. Secondary end points included overall response and duration of response. Progression-free survival was an exploratory end point. Sixty-five patients (median 5 prior lines of therapy; 61.5% triple-class refractory; 24.6% bispecific antibody-exposed) received talquetamab plus daratumumab (QW, n = 14; Q2W, n = 51; median follow-up: 18.6 months).

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the PD-1 inhibitor retifanlimab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment for non-squamous or squamous metastatic NSCLC. METHODS: POD1UM-304 was a phase 3, multiregional, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study conducted in approximately 124 hospitals and private clinical centres in 16 countries. Male and female adults aged 18 years or older with squamous or non-squamous stage IV NSCLC (staging by American Joint Committee on Cancer version 8) with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1 and no previous systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) using interactive response technology to receive intravenous retifanlimab 375 mg or matching placebo on day 1 of each 21-day cycle plus standard platinum-based chemotherapy according to tumour histology for up to 2 years. Patients with non-squamous NSCLC received pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 for four cycles, or carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 5 on day 1 for four cycles, followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each subsequent 21-day cycle, all administered intravenously, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with squamous NSCLC received intravenous carboplatin AUC 6 plus intravenous paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) on day 1 for four cycles or intravenous nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15 for four cycles. Treatment with retifanlimab or placebo was given for up to 35 cycles, unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression tumour proportion score, geographical region, and predominant tumour histology. The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as time from randomisation until death due to any cause, analysed in the full analysis set. Safety was evaluated in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04205812) and is active but no longer enrolling. FINDINGS: Between Sept 11, 2020, and March 14, 2023, 1388 patients were assessed for eligibility, 583 of whom were randomly assigned to retifanlimab plus chemotherapy (n=391) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=192). 381 (65%) patients had non-squamous NSCLC and 202 (35%) had squamous NSCLC; 467 (80%) patients were male and 116 (20%) were female. Median age was 64 years (IQR 58-68). Median overall survival was longer in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group (18·1 months [95% CI 16·2-21·0] vs 13·4 months [11·0-16·7]; hazard ratio 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0042). Overall, higher incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events that were serious (158 [41%] of 389 vs 57 [30%] of 190), grade 3 or worse (238 [61%] vs 103 [54%]), or led to retifanlimab or placebo dose delay (169 [43%] vs 67 [35%]) or discontinuation (33 [8%] vs nine [5%]) were observed in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group than in the placebo plus chemotherapy group. The proportions of fatal COVID-19-related treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in the retifanlimab plus chemotherapy group and the placebo plus chemotherapy group (four [1%] vs five [3%]). INTERPRETATION: Retifanlimab improved overall survival compared with placebo when added to platinum-based chemotherapy, with a safety profile that is representative of previous PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitor-chemotherapy combinations. Adding retifanlimab to first-line chemotherapy could be a potential treatment option for patients with squamous or non-squamous metastatic NSCLC. FUNDING: Incyte.",The Lancet.

Losing 5%-10% of body weight is considered clinically significant for improving health. This weight loss can be achieved through pharmacotherapy, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide dual receptor agonists, and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon triple receptor agonists (such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide, respectively). While much of the weight loss comes from fat mass, these treatments also result in the loss of lean mass, including muscle. This loss of muscle may contribute to difficulties in maintaining weight over the long term and can lead to sarcopenia. Therefore, the focus of new anti-obesity treatments should be primarily on reducing fat mass while minimizing the loss of muscle mass, ideally promoting muscle gain. Research focusing on human myocytes has identified more than 600 myokines associated with muscle contraction, which may play a crucial role in preserving both muscle mass and function. We explored the potential of new anti-obesity agents and their combinations with incretin-based therapies to achieve these outcomes.

Employing multi-trait analysis, we pursue diverse strategies to unveil shared genetic elements, encompassing SNPs, genes, gene sets, and functional categories with pleiotropic implications. Our study systematically quantifies genetic overlap beyond genome-wide genetic correlations across CVDs, while identifying a putative causal relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). We then pinpointed 38 genomic loci with pleiotropic influence across CVDs, of which the most influential pleiotropic locus is located at the LPA gene. Notably, 12 loci present high evidence of multi-trait colocalization and display congruent directional effects. Examination of genes and gene sets linked to these loci unveiled robust associations with circulatory system development processes.

Whether the distribution of adiposity plays a similar role is unclear. METHODS: We used 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to examine causal relationships of 5 adiposity distribution traits (abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT); visceral adipose tissue (VAT); gluteofemoral adipose tissue (GFAT); liver fat; and pancreas fat) with the risks of 12 obesity-related cancers (endometrial, ovarian, breast, colorectal, pancreas, multiple myeloma, liver, kidney (renal cell), thyroid, gallbladder, esophageal adenocarcinoma, and meningioma). RESULTS: Sample size across all genome-wide association studies (GWAS) ranged from 8407 to 728 896 (median: 57 249). We found evidence that higher genetically predicted ASAT increased the risks of endometrial cancer, liver cancer, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per standard deviation (SD) higher ASAT = 1.79 (1.18 to 2.71), 3.83 (1.39 to 10.53), and 2.34 (1.15 to 4.78), respectively). Conversely, we found evidence that higher genetically predicted GFAT decreased the risks of breast cancer and meningioma (ORs and 95% CIs per SD higher genetically predicted GFAT = 0.77 (0.62 to 0.97) and 0.53 (0.32 to 0.90), respectively). We also found evidence for an effect of higher genetically predicted VAT and liver fat on increased liver cancer risk (ORs and 95% CIs per SD higher genetically predicted adiposity trait = 4.29 (1.41 to 13.07) and 4.09 (2.29 to 7.28), respectively).

Endogenous ICLs can be induced by reactive aldehydes produced during normal cellular metabolism. Defective repair of these aldehyde-induced ICLs is associated with Fanconi anaemia (FA), a cancer predisposition syndrome. We previously showed that acetaldehyde-induced ICLs are repaired by the FA pathway and a novel excision-independent pathway. Here, we demonstrate that ICLs induced by acrolein, another cellular aldehyde, are also repaired by both pathways, establishing the generality of aldehyde ICL repair. Focusing on the FA pathway, we identify DNA polymerase kappa (Polκ) as the primary translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase responsible for the insertion step during lesion bypass of unhooked aldehyde ICLs. This function requires Polκ's catalytic activity and PCNA interaction domains but is independent of Rev1 interaction. In contrast, Polκ has a non-catalytic role in the extension step of cisplatin ICL repair that is dependent on Rev1 interaction. Our work reveals a key role for Polκ in aldehyde ICL repair and provides mechanistic insights into how different ICL structures determine the choice of TLS polymerases during repair.",Nucleic acids research,23/09/2025

They received intravenous paracetamol or a placebo for four days. In 2015-2017, we followed up 44 infants (92%) at two years of corrected age. This included clinical and neurodevelopmental assessments and a parental medical history questionnaire. RESULTS: The 44 infants (55% boys) were born at 23(5) -31(6) weeks of gestation. No differences in the cardiac parameters, including blood pressures and ultrasound scan results, were found. Neurodevelopmental stages, as quantified by the Griffiths test, were similar. No signs of autism were reported. Asthma medication was more common in the control group, but the difference was not significant.

Larger trials are needed on the safety and efficacy of paracetamol prophylaxis for early ductal closure in very preterm infants.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",01/03/2019
10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2025.105216,Nursing judgment in the age of generative artificial intelligence: A cross-national study on clinical decision-making performance among emergency nurses.,"Levin C, Zaboli A, Turcato G, Saban M","BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy. METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess predictive accuracy. RESULTS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued importance of human clinical judgment.",International journal of nursing studies,12/09/2025

Here we employed pharmacological inhibition and metabolomics analysis to show that the metabolic pathways of oxaloacetate (OAA) are integrated with antiviral responses to influenza virus. Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 senses intracellular OAA to undergo dimerization and functions as a scaffold to recruit the transcription factor ETS2 for phosphorylation by the kinase TAOK1 at serine 313. The phosphorylated ETS2 translocates into the nucleus and supports optimal expression of TBK1, an indispensable activator of type I interferon responses. OAA supplementation provides a broad-spectrum antiviral ability, and OAA deficiency caused by Acly genetic ablation decreases antiviral immunity and renders mice more susceptible to lethal H1N1 virus infection. Our results uncover a signalling pathway through cellular OAA sensing that links metabolism and innate immunity to coordinate defence against viral challenge.",Nature microbiology,22/09/2025

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing PPTC-specific pathobiology remain elusive. Through high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of 90234 cellular transcriptomes from 4 PPTC and 9 APTC clinical specimens, a phenotypically distinct cellular subpopulation (ITGA2(hi)-PTC cells) mechanistically responsible for PPTC's distinct clinical behavior, is identified. By integrating PPTC-derived organoid models with in vivo functional validation and multiplex immunohistochemistry, it is demonstrated that ITGA2 orchestrates dual oncogenic pathways: 1) augmentation of glycolytic flux and 2) induction of M2 macrophage polarization. These synergistic mechanisms fundamentally drive PPTC oncogenesis and metastatic progression. Cross-validation across independent clinical cohorts consistently confirms the translational significance of these findings. Our multi-omics characterization of PPTC-specific cellular ecosystems and signaling cascades establishes a mechanistic framework for advancing diagnostic precision and targeted therapeutic development.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",23/09/2025

However, the relationship between combined assessment of SHR and GV and mortality risk in sepsis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the associations of SHR, GV, and their combination with sepsis mortality among individuals with different glucose metabolic states, and to develop a mortality prediction model using machine learning (ML) models. METHODS: Patients with sepsis were screened in the MIMIC-IV database, stratified into normal glucose regulation (NGR), pre-diabetes mellitus(Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus(DM) groups based on glucose metabolic status. Associations with mortality were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier(KM) curves, Cox proportional hazards model, restricted cubic splines(RCS), and landmark analyses. Five ML algorithms were employed for prediction, with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) interpreting key predictors. RESULTS: A total of 4,838 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 68 years. Overall, 641 patients (13.2%) died in the ICU, and 936 patients (19.3%) died within 28 days after admission to the ICU. In NGR patients, combined high SHR (>1.23; highest tertile) and high GV (>28.56; highest tertile)-determined based on tertile distribution-conferred the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.40-3.04). Pre-DM patients with low SHR/high GV (SHR<1.23, GV>28.56) showed the greatest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.73-3.48). DM patients with high SHR/low GV (SHR>1.23, GV<28.56) had the highest 28-day mortality risk (HR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.06-2.01). Machine learning models-particularly XGBoost (AUC: 0.746), Random Forest (AUC: 0.776), and Logistic Regression (AUC: 0.776)-demonstrated the strongest predictive performance for these endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: The combined assessment of SHR and GV may provide useful information for predicting mortality in sepsis patients-particularly among individuals with NGR and Pre-DM. This integrated approach highlights the potential need for personalized glycemic management strategies, which warrants further investigation in prospective studies.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",24/09/2025

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid (BA) receptor, has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for various liver diseases. Both BA composition and FXR isoforms have been shown to be significantly altered in human HCCs. This study aimed to investigate their potential roles in MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: HCC was induced in mice by hydrodynamic injection with MYC and MCL1 oncogenes. UPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed elevated BA levels, particularly primary conjugated BAs, in both serum and livers of MYC-driven HCC mice. qPCR and western blot analyses demonstrated suppression of BSEP and dysregulation of FXR splicing in the livers of these mice. Using RNA antisense purification coupled with mass spectrometry (RAP-MS), the splicing factor SF3B3 was identified as a regulator of FXR splicing. Both in silico and in vitro studies confirmed that SF3B3 is a direct downstream target of MYC in mice and humans. Functionally, overexpression of Fxrα2 and Fxrα4 or deletion of Sf3b3 significantly impeded MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Moreover, combination treatment with a SF3B inhibitor and an FXR agonist synergistically suppressed proliferation of HCC cells. Analysis of clinical HCC samples revealed a positive correlation between SF3B3 and the relative expression of FXRα2. CONCLUSIONS: SF3B3 is a key downstream effector of MYC-driven hepatocarcinogenesis and a critical regulator of FXR splicing. Both SF3B3 and FXR represent druggable vulnerabilities in MYC-amplified HCC.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",23/09/2025

However, the involvement of N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modifications in this process remains elusive. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and m(6)A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) across multiple time points postinjury revealed a strong correlation between m(6)A modifications and genes enriched in microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, the m(6)A demethylase ALKBH5 was identified as a key regulator of dynamic m(6)A patterns at the injury site. ALKBH5 suppression in microglia/macrophages exacerbated neuroinflammation in vitro and worsened neurological deficits in controlled cortical impact (CCI) models. MeRIP-qPCR and RNA pull-down assays revealed SOCS3 was a downstream target of ALKBH5-mediated m(6)A demethylation. This demethylation stabilized Socs3 mRNA and enhanced its protein expression, which in turn suppressed neuroinflammation via inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. Conversely, SOCS3 depletion impaired functional recovery after injury.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from inception to 23 August 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Studies that developed or externally validated multivariable models to predict CTRCD risk in young people (children, adolescents, and young adults (≤39 years)) or older adults (≥40 years) with cancer or cancer survivors treated with systemic antineoplastic agents. Studies on radiation induced cardiotoxicity were excluded. METHODS: Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool. Performance measures were pooled using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: 56 studies were included, reporting 51 developed models and 12 externally validated models. Most models were developed in adults (n=34/51, 67%), primarily for breast cancer (n=20/34, 59%) or haematological malignancies (n=6/34, 18%) to determine pretreatment risk (n=33/34, 97%). In young people, most developed models (n=16/17, 94%) focused on long term risk assessment, mostly in survivors of haematological malignancies. Discrimination and calibration metrics were reported for 13/51 (25%) developed models and 6/44 (14%) external validations. Nearly all models were at high risk of bias. 12/51 (24%) developed models underwent external validation, four of 17 (24%) in young people and eight of 34 (24%) in adult populations. The Heart Failure Association-International Cardio-Oncology Society (HFA-ICOS) tool was the most frequently validated (11 times), mainly in patients with breast cancer receiving HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) targeted therapies (5/11, 45%). Across all external validations, this tool consistently underestimated risk, with observed event rates exceeding predicted risks, especially in studies where mild CTRCD was the most frequently reported outcome. Among patients with breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 agents, the pooled C statistic was 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.68). In this population, observed pooled event rates were 12% in the low risk group (<2% predicted), 15% in the medium risk group (2-9%), 25% in the high risk group (10-19%), and 41% in the very high risk group (≥20%). CONCLUSIONS: Existing prediction models for CTRCD need additional evidence before widespread clinical adoption. Poor reporting of key performance metrics and limited external validation studies currently restrict their thorough evaluation. The HFA-ICOS tool shows suboptimal performance, especially when mild forms of CTRCD are included as events. Future research should prioritise validating and updating existing models using large, clustered datasets across various malignancies to enhance the assessment of their performance, generalisability, and clinical utility in routine practice.

While IL-17 pathways are implicated in PPP, IL-17 blockers have shown modest efficacy, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of IL-17 involvement. To dissect the cellular and spatial architecture of PPP, we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on lesional, nonlesional, and healthy acral skin to examine cellular composition, transcriptomic profiles, and cell-cell interactions. Unbiased clustering revealed 9 major cell types, including an inflammatory keratinocyte subset enriched in IL-17A/TNF signatures and marked by high IL-36G expression. Within the lymphocyte compartment, we identified a hybrid ""regTh17"" population coexpressing regulatory markers (FOXP3, CTLA4, TIGIT), IL17F, and IL26. This regTh17 subset was distinguished by elevated IL1R1 and CD39, suggesting an IL-1β-driven differentiation. Spatial analyses demonstrated significant neighborhood enrichment of regTh17 cells with IL-36G+ supraspinous keratinocytes. RegTh17 cells were the predominant source of IL-17F and IL-26 signals, whereas keratinocytes were predicted as their main receivers. We further observed regTh17 coexpressing TNFRSF4 (OX40) and TNFRSF18 (GITR) specifically at sites of IL36G+ keratinocyte interactions, implicating these pathways in amplification of the IL-17/IL-36 inflammatory loop. Together, our integrated single-cell and spatial profiling uncovers Th17 plasticity in PPP, identifies a regTh17-keratinocyte interaction, and highlights IL-17F, IL-26, OX40/OX40L, and GITR/GITRL as candidate targets for precision therapies in this challenging disease.",JCI insight,23/09/2025

There were no significant differences in sRAGE levels between adolescents with or without metabolic syndrome, nor between boys and girls. Also, there were no significant differences in sRAGE levels between with or without insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: sRAGE levels of the adolescents with obesity decreased. There was no difference in sRAGE levels between those with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome compared to those without. Metabolic complications associated with obesity are important in terms of causing mortality and morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms could help to identify therapeutic strategies.

10.1002/advs.202503897,Histone Lactylation-Driven Upregulation of VRK1 Expression Promotes Stemness and Proliferation of Glioma Stem Cells.,"Li J, Tang C, Zhang X, Xing R, Guo Q","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults, with glioma stem cells (GSCs) as a subpopulation contributing to treatment resistance and recurrence. This study investigates the role of lactate and its regulatory gene, vaccinia-related kinase 1 (VRK1), in the regulation of GSC stemness. Utilizing multiple glioma-related databases and patient-derived GSCs, it is discovered that lactate enhances the stemness and proliferation of GSCs via VRK1. Mechanistically, lactate promotes histone lactylation (H3K18la) at the VRK1 promoter in GSCs, thereby upregulating VRK1 expression. VRK1 enhances Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, and phosphorylates YBX1 to promote its nuclear translocation, thereby regulating GSC stemness and proliferation via the YBX1/SOX2 pathway. Additionally, the VRK1-targeted nanoliposome A/TMZ-siVRK1 effectively suppresses the stemness and proliferation of GSCs, demonstrating its therapeutic potential. In conclusion, lactate regulates the stemness and proliferation of GSCs via the H3K18la/VRK1/YBX1/SOX2 pathway. This study elucidates the role of histone lactylation in stem cell regulation and suggests that VRK1 is a potential therapeutic target for GBM.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025

Clinical investigations have identified a strong correlation between sarcopenia and several prevalent degenerative skeletal muscle disorders. This correlation is attributed to imbalances in joint mechanics resulting from localized muscle atrophy and the influence of musculoskeletal secretory factors. In this review, we discuss the broader implications of sarcopenia and critically evaluate the currently established assessment methods. Furthermore, the clinical significance of prevalent musculoskeletal disorders (including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and spinal pathologies) in relation to sarcopenia, alongside the underlying mechanisms influencing this relationship, is summarized. Additionally, the effects of sarcopenia on the therapeutic efficacy of medications and surgical interventions for musculoskeletal conditions are reviewed. Sarcopenia is intricately linked to the onset, progression, and prognosis of musculoskeletal disorders. Future research should prioritize elucidating the potential mechanisms that connect muscle loss with skeletal muscle diseases, and investigating whether mitigating sarcopenia symptoms could decelerate the progression of these disorders, thereby paving new pathways for therapeutic interventions.",Bone research,23/09/2025

The 2022 publication of revised consensus diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy and the emergence of promising biomarkers provides a thorough diagnostic framework that now enables the diagnosis of numerous acquired causes of SLOCA, including autoimmune disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The ongoing development and increased availability of DNA sequencing technology have uncovered several molecular causes of SLOCA besides spastic paraplegia type 7 and very late-onset Friedreich ataxia. These additional causes include sporadic genetic disorders, such as spinocerebellar atrophy type 27B, caused by GAA expansion in the FGF14 gene, and cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), caused by biallelic expansions in the RFC1 gene. This Review presents an updated clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of SLOCA that focuses on the most important developments in this field. Future challenges are also discussed, including the identification of additional missing genetic causes of SLOCA, especially via the use of long-read genome sequencing, improvements in SLOCA prognostication and the implementation of clinical trials of neuroprotective interventions.",Nature reviews.

Through genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identified the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a critical dependency in CCA. Compound screens revealed that the VCP inhibitor CB-5339 potently suppresses CCA proliferation in a panel of patient-derived organoids by inducing cellular senescence. It is known that senescent cells persist, and this can contribute to therapy resistance. To address this, we combined CB-5339 with senolytic agents (ABT-263 and conatumumab), which selectively eliminate senescent CCA cells, resulting in enhanced tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. Clinical analysis showed that VCP overexpression in CCA patients correlates with poor prognosis.

The aim of this analysis is to examine predicted CVD risk reduction following weight loss in persons with obesity for primary prevention between tirzepatide and semaglutide, and projected CVD events that could be potentially prevented in the USA. METHODS AND RESULTS: SURMOUNT-5 was a Phase 3b, open-label, randomized trial conducted in participants with obesity and without Type-2 diabetes, comparing tirzepatide (10 or 15 mg) with semaglutide (1.7 or 2.4 mg) and administered via weekly subcutaneous injection. Predicted 10-year CVD risks were compared between treatments at baseline and up to 72 weeks post-treatment among participants without prior CVD. The impact of cardiovascular risk reduction was estimated as the projected preventable CVD events over 10 years for tirzepatide and semaglutide in the USA. The average predicted 10-year CVD risk score before treatment was 9.3%. Treatment with tirzepatide was associated with significantly greater reduction in predicted 10-year CVD risk compared with semaglutide (absolute reduction from baseline of 2.4% and 1.4%, respectively, P < 0.001). Translating risk reduction to the US population who met treatment eligibility criteria and without prior CVD (∼85 million), an estimated 2 million CVD events could be potentially prevented over 10 years after 72 weeks of tirzepatide treatment, vs. 1.15 million with semaglutide. CONCLUSION: In SURMOUNT-5, treatment with tirzepatide was associated with greater predicted 10-year CVD risk reduction compared with semaglutide. This post hoc analysis suggests tirzepatide treatment may provide greater benefit in primary prevention of CVD than semaglutide in people with obesity and overweight.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort and case-control analyses combined with linear and non-linear Mendelian randomisation. SETTING: Two large-scale population-based cohorts: the US Million Veteran Programme and the UK Biobank. Genetic analyses used summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). PARTICIPANTS: 559 559 adults aged 56-72 years at baseline were included in observational analyses (mean follow-up: 4 years in the US cohort; 12 years in the UK cohort). Genetic analyses used summary data from multiple large GWAS consortia (2.4 million participants). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident all-cause dementia, determined through health record linkage, and genetic proxies. RESULTS: During follow-up, 14 540 participants developed dementia and 48 034 died. Observational phenotype-only analyses revealed U-shaped associations between alcohol and dementia risk: higher risk was observed among non-drinkers, heavy drinkers (>40 drinks per week; HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.74), and those with alcohol use disorder (AUD) (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.60) compared with light drinkers. In contrast, Mendelian randomisation genetic analysis identified a monotonic increase in dementia risk with greater alcohol consumption. A 1 SD increase in log-transformed drinks per week was associated with a 15% dementia increase (inverse-variance weighted (IVW) OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.27). A twofold increase in AUD prevalence was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk (IVW OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.30). Alcohol intake increased dementia, but individuals who developed dementia also experienced a decline in alcohol intake over time, suggesting reverse causation-where early cognitive decline leads to reduced alcohol consumption-underlies the supposed protective alcohol effects in observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence for a relationship between all types of alcohol use and increased dementia risk. While correlational observational data suggested a protective effect of light drinking, this could be in part attributable to reduced drinking seen in early dementia; genetic analyses did not support any protective effect, suggesting that any level of alcohol consumption may contribute to dementia risk. Public health strategies that reduce the prevalence of alcohol use disorder could potentially lower the incidence of dementia by up to 16%.",BMJ evidence-based medicine,23/09/2025

The results revealed that CON could effectively inhibit the proliferation of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After 4 h of incubation with CON at the minimum inhibitory concentration (0.125 mg/mL), the relative fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide and 1-N-phenylnapthylamine (NPN) was increased by 32.0% and 351.4%, respectively. The membrane permeability of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells was significantly disrupted after CON treatment, resulting in the leakage of intracellular substances (such as proteins and electrolytes). CON also caused significant increases in the DiBAC(4)(3) fluorescence intensity of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells. These results demonstrate that CON induced inactivation of P. deceptionensis CM2 by destroying the integrity and function of bacterial membrane. A higher level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in CON-treated cells (p < 0.05), compared with control cells. Moreover, the addition of glutathione to the growth medium remarkably decreased the antimicrobial activity of CON against P. deceptionensis CM2, further confirming that oxidative stress played an important role in the antimicrobial activity of CON. Overall, CON may exhibit antibacterial effects by causing damage to the bacterial membranes and oxidative stress.",Heliyon,01/09/2023

As characterized by its aberrant nuclear export and cytoplasmic aggregation, TDP43 proteinopathy is a hallmark feature in over 95% of ALS/FTD cases, leading to detrimental cytosolic aggregates and a reduction in nuclear functionality in neurons. Building on our prior work linking TDP43 proteinopathy to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons, the present investigation uncovers a novel regulatory relationship between TDP43 and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene expression. Here, we show that TDP43 depletion or overexpression directly affects the expression of key MMR genes. Alterations include changes in MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS2 levels across various primary cell lines, independent of their proliferative status. Our results specifically establish that TDP43 selectively influences the expression of MLH1 and MSH6 by influencing their alternative transcript splicing patterns and stability. We furthermore find that aberrant MMR gene expression is linked to TDP43 proteinopathy in two distinct ALS mouse models and in post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissues of ALS patients. Notably, MMR depletion resulted in the partial rescue of TDP43 proteinopathy-induced DNA damage and signaling. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA cancer database reveals significant associations between TDP43 expression, MMR gene expression, and mutational burden across multiple cancers. Collectively, our findings implicate TDP43 as a critical regulator of the MMR pathway and unveil its broad impact on the etiology of both neurodegenerative and neoplastic pathologies.",Nucleic acids research,23/09/2025

Although considered as safe when taken in recommended doses not higher than 4 g/day, APAP overdose is currently the most important cause of acute liver failure (ALF). ALF may require liver transplantation and can be fatal. The reasons for APAP-related ALF are mostly intentional (suicidal) or unintentional overdose. However, results from large scale epidemiological studies provide increasing evidence for second generation effects of APAP, even when taken in pharmacological doses. Most strikingly, APAP medication during pregnancy has been associated with health problems including neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and increase in the risk of wheezing and incidence of asthma among offspring.

Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway to induce type I interferons (IFNs) and signaling through NF-κB, thus instigating host defenses and pathological inflammation. However, the mechanism underlying STING-induced NF-κB activation is unknown. Here we report that STING activates NF-κB in a delayed manner, following exit from the Golgi to endolysosomal compartments. Activation of NF-κB is dependent on the IFN-inducing transcription factor IRF3 but is independent of type I IFN signaling. This activation pattern is evolutionarily conserved in tetrapods. Mechanistically, the monomer IRF3 is recruited to STING pS358, with delayed kinetics relative to IRF3 recruitment to STING pS366, which promotes type I IFN responses. IRF3 engagement with STING pS358 induces trafficking to late endolysosomal compartments, supporting recruitment of TRAF6 and activation of NF-κB. We identify a TRAF6 binding motif in IRF3 that facilitates recruitment of TRAF6. This work defines a signaling surface on STING and a function for IRF3 as an adaptor in immune signaling. These findings indicate that STING signaling to NF-κB is enabled only within a short time window between exit from the Golgi and lysosomal degradation, possibly limiting inflammation under homeostatic and danger-sensing conditions.",Nature immunology,19/09/2025

All those with and a random sample of those without self-reported change or loss in smell or taste were offered olfactory testing, performed at 83 sites in 35 US states and territories. Participants included 2956 enrollees with prior infection (1393 with and 1563 without self-reported change or loss) and 569 without prior infection (9 with and 560 without self-reported change or loss in taste) who underwent olfactory testing a mean (SD) of 671.6 (417.8) days after the index date.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Olfactory function, as defined by age- and sex-standardized performance on the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a well-validated test comprising 40 unique odors. RESULTS: The study included 3525 participants with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (15.2) years; of 3520 with data available, 2548 (72.4%) were female or intersex. Among 1393 infected participants with self-reported change or loss, 1111 (79.8%) had hyposmia on the UPSIT, including 321 (23.0%) with severe microsmia or anosmia. Among 1563 infected participants without self-reported change or loss, 1031 (66.0%) had hyposmia, including 128 (8.2%) with severe microsmia or anosmia. Participants with prior infection and self-reported change or loss scored at the 16th age- and sex-standardized UPSIT percentile, compared with the 23rd and 28th percentiles for those without self-reported change or loss with and without prior known infection, respectively. Younger women had scores corresponding to lower mean age- and sex-standardized percentiles. Among participants who self-reported change or loss in smell, those with abnormal UPSIT scores more often reported cognitive problems (742 of 1111 [66.8%]) than those with normal UPSIT scores (179 of 282 [63.5%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of RECOVER-Adult participants, self-reported change or loss in smell or taste was an accurate signal of verified hyposmia, but a high rate of hyposmia among those with no reported change or loss was also observed.

Treatments that influence this dysregulated host response are sparse. The immunopathophysiology of sepsis entails overzealous inflammation causing acute organ dysfunction, as well as a profound and/or persistent anti-inflammatory response that increases susceptibility to secondary infection. The immune response in sepsis is under the influence of various endogenous and exogenous factors, including genetic makeup, age, sex, comorbidities, metabolism, prior microbial exposure and medications. The consequent heterogeneity of the syndrome hampers immunomodulatory treatment strategies that rely on a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. A precision medicine approach is therefore warranted. Balanced application of prognostic- and predictive-enrichment strategies is instrumental to achieve precision medicine. Phenotyping of patients using clinical, physiological, microbiological and/or molecular ('omics') data enables the identification of more homogeneous patient subgroups. Several studies suggest that such approaches can be used to tailor adjunctive immunomodulatory therapies in patients with sepsis.

METHODS: We crossed pink1 knockout with APP/PS1 mice, and assessed behavioral and pathological phenotypes of the resulting animals. We also performed biochemical and biophysical characterizations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) phosphorylation of α-syn. RESULTS: DLB brains show PINK1 deficiency alongside α-syn and Aβ co-pathology. Mirroring human DLB patients, APP/PS1::pink1-/- mice spontaneously develop Lewy pathology at endogenous α-syn levels, affecting both central and peripheral nervous systems with heterogeneous phenotypes. Mechanistically, PINK1 phosphorylates α-syn at Thr44, suppressing Aβ-induced α-syn aggregation. Moreover, pT44-α-syn levels are correlated with PINK1 expression and activity in human brains. DISCUSSION: PINK1 deficiency synergizes with Aβ to promote Lewy pathology via loss of protective α-syn phosphorylation. The APP/PS1::pink1-/- model recapitulates key DLB features without α-syn overexpression, offering a valuable tool for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies. HIGHLIGHTS: PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) deficiency, either through reduced expression or impaired activity, is found in human dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients with amyloid beta (Aβ) co-pathology. PINK1 specifically phosphorylates α-synuclein at Thr44, inhibiting Aβ-induced aggregation and preventing the development of Lewy pathology. The APP/PS1::pink1-/- mouse model recapitulates key features of human DLB, exhibiting widespread Lewy pathology and heterogeneous phenotypes.

To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis.

Here we show that two key meiosis-defining proteins, the topoisomerase Spo11 (which forms double-strand breaks) and the meiotic cohesin Rec8, can dismantle centromeres. This dismantlement is normally observable only in mutant cells that lack the telomere bouquet, which provides a nuclear microdomain conducive to centromere reassembly(1); however, overexpression of Spo11 or Rec8 leads to levels of centromere dismantlement that cannot be countered by the bouquet. Specific nucleosome remodelling factors mediate centromere dismantlement by Spo11 and Rec8. Ectopic expression of either protein in proliferating cells leads to the loss of mitotic kinetochores in both fission yeast and human cells. Hence, while centromeric chromatin has been characterized as extraordinarily stable, Spo11 and Rec8 challenge this stability and may jeopardize kinetochores in cancers that express meiotic proteins.",Nature,01/03/2021

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various neurological disorder processes by regulating programmed cell death. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA, lncMCL1, by high-throughput screening, which suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent neural pyroptosis in epilepsy. We demonstrated that lncMCL1 is aberrantly underexpressed in the hippocampus and cortex of epilepsy patients, a phenomenon that was validated in various mouse and rat epilepsy models. Through CRISPR/Cas9, siRNA, and viral manipulation, gain- and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that lncMCL1 inhibits neuronal pyroptosis in vivo and in vitro and exerts antiepileptic effects. Mechanistically, lncMCL1 acts as a scaffold to modulate DDX3X protein stabilization by enhancing NEDD4-mediated DDX3X K48 ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting neural pyroptosis through the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. Additionally, IL-18/IL-1β, downstream cytokines of pyroptosis, inhibit lncMCL1 expression through the activation of a shared pathway, the STAT3 pathway, forming a feedback loop. Our findings identify lncMCL1 as a critical regulator of neural cell pyroptosis and a promising therapeutic target for refractory epilepsy.",Cell death and differentiation,22/09/2025

Although SkM-EVs are increasingly being explored as a therapeutic strategy to enhance muscle regeneration or to induce the myogenic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the mechanisms governing their release from muscle cells remain poorly described. Moreover, because muscle regeneration involves a tightly regulated inflammatory response it also important to determine how inflammation alters SkM-EV cargo and function in order to design more effective EV-based therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we isolated and characterized the large and small EVs (lEVs, sEVs) released from SkM cells under basal conditions and in response to TNF-α, a well-established inflammatory mediator elevated in both acute muscle injury and chronic inflammatory conditions such as type 2 diabetes. We then evaluated the regenerative roles of these EV subtypes in vivo using a mouse model of cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury, with a specific focus on their bioactive sphingolipid content. Using transmission, scanning or cryo-electron microscopy, lipidomic profiling and an adenoviral construct to express labelled CD63 in myotubes, we demonstrated that SkM cells release both sEVs and lEVs primarily from the plasma membrane. Notably, sEVs were generated from specialized membrane folds enriched in the EV markers ALIX (ALG-2 interacting protein X) and TSG101, as well as lipid raft-associated lipids. During regeneration, sEVs promoted M1 macrophage polarization and migration and muscle stem cell (MuSC) differentiation, thereby accelerating muscle repair. In contrast, lEVs inhibited and promoted MuSC proliferation and impaired the transition from the pro-inflammatory to the anti-inflammatory response, an essential step for promoting MuSC differentiation. Treatment of isolated muscle fibres with SkM-EVs revealed that the distinct effects of sEVs and lEVs on MuSC behaviour and macrophage phenotype could be largely explained by differences in their lipid composition, particularly the ratio of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) subspecies. However, TNF-α exposure altered these ratios in sEVs and impaired their regenerative functions on MuSC and their effect on macrophage migration and polarization. These results demonstrate for the first time the importance of the sphingolipid content of EVs released by skeletal muscle in their regenerative function within muscle tissue, largely explained by their role as carriers of different subspecies of sphingosine-1-phosphate. This suggests that modulating the sphingolipid composition of EVs could be a viable strategy to enhance the regenerative potential of muscle tissue in addition to therapeutic interventions.",Journal of extracellular vesicles,01/09/2025
10.1186/s12944-025-02716-1,Association between atherogenic index of plasma and tinnitus: evidence from NHANES and the mediating role of hypertension.,"Miao W, Wu C, Yuan D, Li Y, Wu T","BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a prevalent auditory disorder that significantly affects quality of life, with emerging evidence suggesting a connection between metabolic dysregulation and tinnitus pathogenesis. The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), a marker of atherogenic lipid metabolism, has been associated with cardiovascular disease risk but remains underexplored in the context of tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between AIP and tinnitus prevalence in U.S. adults, and to further examine whether hypertension mediates this association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2,464 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2012). Tinnitus status was determined by self-report, and AIP was calculated as log10(triglycerides/HDL-C). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between AIP and tinnitus. Stratified analyses and mediation analysis were conducted to explore effect modification and the mediating role of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as a self-reported physician diagnosis or use of antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Elevated AIP was significantly associated with an increased risk of tinnitus in a dose-response manner (fully adjusted OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52, P = 0.01). Stronger associations were observed in younger participants, females, non-Hispanic Whites, and smokers. Mediation analysis showed that hypertension partially mediated the association between AIP and Tinnitus, accounting for 17.53% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: Higher AIP is associated with greater tinnitus prevalence, with hypertension serving as a partial mediator. These findings highlight the potential value of AIP as a metabolic biomarker for tinnitus risk stratification and emphasize the importance of managing metabolic dysregulation in tinnitus prevention.",Lipids in health and disease,22/09/2025

LAP plays roles in innate immunity, inflammation and anticancer responses, and is initiated following phagocytosis of particles that stimulate Toll-like receptors (TLR) and Fc receptors as well as following engulfment of dying cells. However, how this molecular process is initiated remains elusive. Here we report that receptors that engage LAP enrich phosphatidylserine (PS) in the phagosome membrane via membrane-proximal domains that are necessary and sufficient for LAP to proceed. Subsequently, PS recruits the Rubicon-containing PI3-kinase complex to initiate the enzymatic cascade leading to LAP. Manipulation of plasma membrane PS content, PS binding by Rubicon or the PS-clustering domains of receptors prevents LAP and delays phagosome maturation. Therefore, the initiation of LAP represents a novel mechanism of PS-mediated signal transduction following ligation of surface receptors.",Nature cell biology,22/09/2025

The clinical presentation of AD is heterogeneous and is characterized by a relapsing and remitting course. Most patients suffer from mild AD while approximately 5% to 20% experience severe disease activity, which often requires systemic treatment. Before 2017, systemic treatment options were limited to broad immunosuppressants, which often had significant toxicity and limited effectiveness. Advances in understanding AD pathophysiology have led to the development of targeted biologic therapies, including dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab, and nemolizumab. These monoclonal antibodies specifically block key pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in AD, improving disease control and symptom relief. Dupilumab, the first approved biologic, inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, while tralokinumab and lebrikizumab selectively block IL-13. Nemolizumab targets IL-31, which plays a crucial role in pruritus. This review summarizes primarily real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of these biologics, providing clinical guidance for their use and management of side effects.

One possibility is to explore genetic modifiers that improve muscle regeneration and function. The beneficial effects of the overexpression of Jagged-1 were described in escaper golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) dogs that had a near-normal life and validated in dystrophin-deficient zebrafish. To clarify the underlying biology of JAG1 overexpression in dystrophic muscles, we generated a transgenic mouse (mdx(5cv)-JAG1) model that lacks dystrophin and overexpresses human JAG1 in striated muscles. Skeletal muscles from mdx(5cv)-JAG1 and mdx(5cv) mice were studied at 1-, 4-, and 12-mo time points. JAG1 expression in mdx(5cv)-JAG1 increased by 3 to 5 times compared to mdx(5cv). Consequently, mdx(5cv)-JAG1 muscles were significantly bigger and stronger than dystrophic controls, along with an increased number of myofibers. Proteomics data show increased dysferlin in mdx(5cv)-JAG1 muscles and an association of the histone methyltransferase Nsd1 with the phenotype.

If true, this would have substantial implications for management of pain and fever during pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy with children's risk of autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide cohort study with sibling control analysis included a population-based sample of 2 480 797 children born in 1995 to 2019 in Sweden, with follow-up through December 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Use of acetaminophen during pregnancy prospectively recorded from antenatal and prescription records. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes in health registers. RESULTS: In total, 185 909 children (7.49%) were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. Crude absolute risks at 10 years of age for those not exposed vs those exposed to acetaminophen were 1.33% vs 1.53% for autism, 2.46% vs 2.87% for ADHD, and 0.70% vs 0.82% for intellectual disability. In models without sibling control, ever-use vs no use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with marginally increased risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]; risk difference [RD] at 10 years of age, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.01% to 0.20%]), ADHD (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10]; RD, 0.21% [95% CI, 0.08%-0.34%]), and intellectual disability (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; RD, 0.04% [95% CI, -0.04% to 0.12%]). To address unobserved confounding, matched full sibling pairs were also analyzed. Sibling control analyses found no evidence that acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with autism (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.93-1.04]; RD, 0.02% [95% CI, -0.14% to 0.18%]), ADHD (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]; RD, -0.02% [95% CI, -0.21% to 0.15%]), or intellectual disability (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92-1.10]; RD, 0% [95% CI, -0.10% to 0.13%]). Similarly, there was no evidence of a dose-response pattern in sibling control analyses. For example, for autism, compared with no use of acetaminophen, persons with low (<25th percentile), medium (25th-75th percentile), and high (>75th percentile) mean daily acetaminophen use had HRs of 0.85, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children's risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis.

The study aimed to explore the association between IC and incident PD and whether genetic risk modulated this association. METHODS: This longitudinal analysis used data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the impact of genetic and environmental factors on health outcomes. Participants were voluntarily recruited from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom between 2006 and 2010. Individuals with IC component data and without pre-existing PD or dementia at baseline were included. The IC deficit score was derived from 4 domains: psychological (exhaustion and sleep duration), sensory (visual and hearing impairments), vitality (grip strength and weight loss), and locomotor function (walking speed), while the cognitive domain was not assessed. Genetic risk was estimated by polygenic risk score, and incident PD was identified using an algorithm. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 401,791 participants (mean age [SD], 56.6 [8.0] years; 53.8% female) included, 2,763 (0.69%) developed PD during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. The HR (95% CI) for incident PD was 1.82 (1.50-2.20) in individuals with IC deficit scores of 4+ compared with those with 0. Each 1-point increment in IC deficit was associated with a 16% (95% CI 12%-20%) increased risk of PD. Low IC was associated with a 68% (95% CI 48%-91%) higher risk of incident PD. Individuals with low IC and high genetic risk were at the highest PD risk (HR = 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.78). High genetic risk attenuated the protective role of high IC (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 [0.35-0.58] in low risk vs 0.72 [0.59-0.88] in high risk; P for interaction = 0.002), but high IC was still associated with a diminished risk of PD in the high-risk group. DISCUSSION: High IC was associated with a decreased risk of PD, even in genetically high-risk individuals. The absence of the cognitive domain may limit understanding of the association.",Neurology,21/10/2025

During aging, alterations in lipid metabolism lead to reduced content of very long-chain PUFAs (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, which is associated with normal age-related reductions in contrast sensitivity, diminished photoreceptor function and delayed rod-mediated dark adaptation recovery, and pathological age-related macular degeneration (AMD). ELOVL2 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids-like 2) encodes a transmembrane protein that produces precursors to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and VLC-PUFAs. The methylation status of the ELOVL2 promoter is currently one of the best predictors of chronological age. Here, we show that lower VLC-PUFA abundance in the aged mouse retina is accompanied by a reduction in visual function. Similarly, mice lacking ELOVL2-specific enzymatic activity (Elovl2(C234W)) demonstrate reduced contrast sensitivity and slower rod-mediated dark adaptation. Intravitreal supplementation with the direct product of ELOVL2, 24:5n-3, in aged animals improved visual function for up to 4 weeks and reduced accumulation of APOE- and C3d-positive sub-RPE deposits. The gene expression pattern observed in supplemented retinas exhibited a partial rejuvenation profile, including decreased expression of aging-related genes and a transcriptomic signature resembling younger retinas. Last, human genetic data from the IAMDGC and UK Biobank linked two variants in the ELOVL2 locus with the onset of intermediate AMD, underlining the translational importance of our findings. Our work highlights VLC-PUFA supplementation as a potential therapeutic opportunity and defines ELOVL2 as a promising target for interventions to prevent age-related vision loss.",Science translational medicine,24/09/2025

However, the role of PYGM in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction (MI) remains unclear. METHODS: The expression profiles of PYGM in cardiac tissues and plasma samples from subjects with MI were assessed using immunoblotting. The role of PYGM in MI was determined by evaluating the effects of PYGM deficiency and its replenishment through adeno-associated virus-mediated PYGM expression in mice with MI. RESULTS: We found that circulating PYGM levels and their cardiac contents were significantly decreased in patients with MI, which was associated with impaired cardiac function. Loss of PYGM significantly exacerbated MI-induced cardiac dysfunction and damage in mice, and replenishment of PYGM profoundly reversed these adverse effects. Mechanistically, PYGM enhanced glycogenolysis by activating glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, thereby improving cardiac energy homeostasis and mitigating oxidative stress. In addition, PYGM improved MI-induced autophagic flux obstacles and alleviated MI-induced cardiac damage by suppressing the expression of Thbs1 (thrombospondin-1). Moreover, genetic deficiency or pharmacological blockage of autophagy attenuated the protective effects of PYGM against MI-induced cardiac injury, and cardiac-specific knockdown of Thbs1 substantially improved the adverse impact of MI on cardiac dysfunction and damage in PYGM-null mice. CONCLUSIONS: PYGM safeguards against MI-induced myocardial injury by stimulating glycogenolysis and promoting autophagic flux, thus preserving myocardial energy homeostasis.",Circulation,24/09/2025

The process is often hijacked by tumor cells at various stages to facilitate cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. It is also recognized as a key contributor to intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), lineage plasticity is central to acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and its associated acinar-to-ductal reprogramming (ADR), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cell (CSC) regeneration, and molecular subtype rewiring. These mechanisms generate diverse lineage trajectories that shape PDAC development, progression, and therapeutic outcomes.

METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for GLP-1 RA RCTs that evaluated pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this risk; subgroup analysis was performed with and without background medications. RESULTS: 62 studies utilising dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, or tirzepatide, with 66,232 patients, mean age of 58.3 years (14.4 to 68), and mean follow-up of 43.5 weeks (1 to 198) were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis (RR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.89, p = 0.009), but not when stratified by background medications (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.87-1.87) and without background medications (RR: 1.37, 95% CI 0.91-2.05).

CONCLUSION: GLP-1 RAs carry a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis, which is not significant when stratified by background medication use. Overall risk for pancreatic cancer was not observed, but a slight association was found when stratified with background medications. However, this difference is likely minimal, given the numerous studies excluded from the meta-analysis where both treatment arms had zero events.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",01/09/2025

Prenatal and postnatal (up to 18 months) acetaminophen exposure was assessed through maternal questionnaires or interviews. ASC and ADHD symptoms were assessed at 4-12 years of age using validated instruments. Children were classified as having borderline/clinical symptoms using recommended cutoffs for each instrument. Hospital diagnoses were also available in one cohort. Analyses were adjusted for child and maternal characteristics along with indications for acetaminophen use. Adjusted cohort-specific effect estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analysis. The proportion of children having borderline/clinical symptoms ranged between 0.9 and 12.9% for ASC and between 1.2 and 12.2% for ADHD. Results indicated that children prenatally exposed to acetaminophen were 19% and 21% more likely to subsequently have borderline or clinical ASC (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.07-1.33) and ADHD symptoms (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.36) compared to non-exposed children. Boys and girls showed higher odds for ASC and ADHD symptoms after prenatal exposure, though these associations were slightly stronger among boys.

Chaihu-shugan-san (CSS) is a Chinese medicine compound with reported neuroprotective properties. However, the precise bioactive constituents and underlying mechanisms of CSS in the context of PD remain poorly defined. PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the therapeutic potential of CSS, characterize its bioactive constituents, and elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms in PD. METHODS: A network pharmacology-bioinformatics framework was established to predict the potential targets of CSS in PD. MPTP-induced PD mouse models were validated by behavioral tests, histopathology (HE staining), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and Western blot (WB). Machine learning and ROC curve analysis pinpointed key ferroptosis-related genes linked to CSS and PD, with functional enrichment highlighting possible pathways. Further validation was performed using IHC, GPx, MDA, and WB assays. UPLC-MS/MS was employed to characterize bioactive CSS components, followed by druggability screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In vitro, MES23.5 cells exposed to MPP⁺ were used to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of Liquiritin (LIQ), the principal active compound in CSS, via CCK-8, LDH, oxidative stress markers (GPx, MDA), lipid peroxidation (C11-BODIPY), iron accumulation (FerroOrange), and WB. Additional validation of ferroptosis modulation was performed in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Multidisciplinary investigations employing prediction and experimental validation consistently demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of CSS against MPTP-induced PD mouse. Machine learning, ROC curve analysis and in vivo validation identified CSS ameliorates PD by inhibiting ferroptosis through PPARα activation. Intriguingly, CSS exhibited therapeutic potential by counteracting ferroptosis-triggered PD-like pathological manifestations in mice. Integrated analysis involving UPLC-MS/MS, druggability screening, molecular docking and MD simulations demonstrated LIQ to be a core bioactive compound in CSS. Mechanistic studies revealed that LIQ protects against MPP(+)- or erastin-induced ferroptosis in MES23.5 cells via activation of the PPARα/SCD1/FADS2 pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of PPARα abolished LIQ's protective effects against both ferroptosis and PD progression, definitively establishing PPARα activation as essential for LIQ-mediated neuroprotection. CONCLUSION: LIQ, a major bioactive component of CSS, ameliorates PD pathology by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the PPARα/SCD1/FADS2 signaling pathway. These findings uncover a novel anti-ferroptosis mechanism and provide a promising therapeutic framework for the prevention and treatment of PD.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,15/09/2025

However, multicenter real-world data on cancer-control outcomes are scant. METHODS: Real-word data from the ARON-3 collaboration in progressive mCRPC patients treated with (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel were collected. A retrospective analysis was performed, including overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF) and PSA50/90 rates. RESULTS: Data from 285 (50.1 %) patients receiving (177)Lu-PSMA vs. 283 (49.9 %) cabazitaxel after one or two lines of ARPI and Docetaxel were analyzed. PSA50 and PSA90 rates were higher, and TTF and OS were significantly longer in (177)Lu-PSMA patients, even after multivariable adjustment (p ≤ 0.01). This effect held true for most subgroups such as age < 70 and ≥ 70 years, ECOG 0-1, distant lymph nodes and one vs. two lines of prior ARPI. Incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events were comparable between both treatments (37 % vs. 43 % for (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel cohort p = 0.5) but differed according to the type of adverse events. Sensitivity analyses with cross-over adjustment showed similar effects. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing the currently largest real-world cohort comparing (177)Lu-PSMA vs. cabazitaxel, we provided robust information of (177)Lu-PSMA being at least equally effective or possibly even superior to cabazitaxel regarding cancer-control outcomes with reasonable side effects.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",12/09/2025
10.3389/fnut.2025.1642913,Advanced lung cancer inflammation index as a new predictor for colon cancer in elderly patients: an NHANES-based study.,"Zhong H, Chen Y, Wu W, Liu S, Fan Y, Liu H, Lin R, Wan J, He M","BACKGROUND: Nutritional and inflammatory status have both been implicated in colon cancer risk. The advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) is a composite prognostic index that incorporates body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), reflecting both nutritional and systemic inflammatory states. However, its role in predicting colon cancer prevalence in elderly individuals remains unclear. METHODS: We used the ALI as a composite marker reflecting both inflammation status and nutritional health. The ALI is calculated as BMI × serum albumin/NLR, where higher values indicate better nutritional status and lower systemic inflammation. To evaluate the association between ALI and colon cancer prevalence, we conducted multivariate logistic regression, applied an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning model, and performed subgroup analyses. Additionally, a smoothed two-piece logistic regression model was used to identify the ALI threshold predictive of colon cancer. RESULTS: The study included 10,137 elderly participants, with a colon cancer prevalence of 2.45%. The ALI was significantly lower in the colon cancer group compared to those without (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression revealed a significant inverse association between ALI and colon cancer (p < 0.05), with individuals in the highest ALI tertile experiencing a 67% lower risk compared to those in the lowest tertile (p for trend = 0.008). Generalized additive models showed a linear relationship, identifying an inflection point at 4.73 and a predictive threshold of 113.3. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, particularly among individuals aged over 70 years, females, unmarried individuals, alcohol consumers, and those with a BMI below 30. In the XGBoost model, ALI demonstrated the highest predictive value for colon cancer (AUC = 0.717), outperforming traditional demographic and clinical variables such as age and BMI. Furthermore, ALI showed a positive association with dietary health status (p < 0.05) but was not significantly related to bowel habits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that ALI, a nutritional-inflammation prognostic index, is significantly and inversely associated with the risk of colon cancer in older adults. Thus, ALI may serve as a promising, non-invasive biomarker for risk stratification, particularly among high-risk subgroups such as unmarried females, alcohol consumers, and those with lower BMI. Its strong predictive value, confirmed by machine learning, supports its potential role in personalized prevention. Further studies are required to explore underlying mechanisms, including dietary and microbial factors.",Frontiers in nutrition,01/01/2025

To that end, repurposed drugs such as metformin have been evaluated against many cancer types, including NSCLC. Metformin, a widely used oral hypoglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, exhibits anticancer properties and synergy with several standards of care agents. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the role and anticancer mechanisms of metformin-based combination approaches for the treatment of NSCLC. We logically discussed the experimental evidence from the in vitro and in vivo studies utilizing metformin alone, and then its combination with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. We also present clinical trials that underscore the beneficial and adverse outcomes of metformin use in combination with targeted therapy and chemotherapeutic agents, and emphasize the limitations and challenges for the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic NSCLC patients. It appears that, regardless of the diverse anticancer mechanisms of this biguanide, the benefits may be confined to a specific patient subgroup, which opens new avenues to be explored for NSCLC treatment.",Military Medical Research,23/09/2025

Here, we show that the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) orchestrates cutaneous inflammation via a transsynaptic brain-skin circuit. Using neural tracing and chemogenetic approaches, we revealed functional connectivity between the PVN and both sympathetic neurons and psoriatic skin. Reactivation of imiquimod (IMQ)-induced PVN-transgenic targeted recombination in active population (TRAP) neurons (which form a specific ""inflammatory memory"") is essential for psoriasis progression and can drive chronic inflammation. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) identified ephrin receptor A7 (Epha7) as a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity in PVN inflammatory engram neurons. The inhibition of Ephrin receptor and ligand binding in the PVN normalized dendritic spine remodelling, suppressed sympathetic nerve hyperactivity, and restored the balance of Th17/Treg cells in psoriatic-like mice. Mechanistically, blockade of the Ephrin receptor attenuated sympathetic norepinephrine overflow, thereby mitigating Th17-driven inflammation. This study identifies a PVN-sympathetic-skin axis in which the inhibition of Epha7 in the PVN restores skin immune homeostasis. Furthermore, this study elucidates the central neural mechanisms of skin inflammation and promotes the transition of psoriasis treatment from single-target approaches to a synergistic neuroimmune strategy involving ""brain-skin"" interactions.",Journal of neuroinflammation,24/09/2025

In contrast with treatment for HIV or hepatitis C, treatment is not indicated for all people with chronic hepatitis B, clinical endpoints are not clear for those receiving treatment, and those for whom treatment is not indicated remain at risk for complications. This topical review examines the data elements necessary to develop and apply chronic hepatitis B CCMs at the jurisdictional health department level. We conducted a nonsystematic review of US-based publications in Ovid MEDLINE (1946-present), Ovid Embase (1974-present), and Scopus (not date limited) databases, which yielded 724 publications for review. Jurisdictional health departments, if properly supported, could develop locale-specific focused CCMs using person-level chronic hepatitis B registries, updated longitudinally using electronic laboratory reporting data and case reporting data. These CCMs could be applied to identify disparities and improve rates in testing and access to care and treatment, which are necessary to reduce liver disease and chronic hepatitis B mortality. Investments in public health surveillance infrastructure, including substantial enhancements in electronic laboratory reporting and case reporting and the use of supplementary data sources, could enable jurisdictional health departments to develop modified CCMs for chronic hepatitis B that focus, at least initially, on ""early"" CCM steps, which emphasize optimization of hepatitis B diagnosis, linkage to care, and ongoing clinical follow-up of diagnosed people, all of which can lead to improved outcomes.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",11/01/2024
10.1136/jitc-2024-010812,Autophagy inhibition improves the efficacy of anlotinib and PD-1 inhibitors in the treatment of NSCLC.,"Tang H, You T, Ge H, Bai C, Wang Y, Sun Z, Han Q, Zhao RC","BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major non-tumor cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are closely related to immune suppression. The enhancement of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) efficacy by antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKIs) is partly due to the elimination of CAFs, which improves the immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, it remains unclear whether antiangiogenic TKIs regulate the autophagy of CAFs, thereby affecting the immunotherapy response. METHODS: We first examined the effects of autophagy inhibition and anlotinib on the TME and immunotherapy response via animal experiments. Then, CAF models were established in vitro. The effects and mechanisms of autophagy inhibition on the efficacy of anlotinib and CAFs were further explored in vitro. To specifically validate the role of CAF autophagy, we additionally constructed LLC tumor-bearing mouse models co-implanted with CAFs transfected with ATG5-targeting siRNA or non-targeting control siRNA. RESULTS: In anti-PD-1-resistant (LLC) and CAF-rich (LA795+MSC) non-small cell lung cancer models, the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine significantly enhanced anlotinib+anti-PD-1 efficacy-likely by inducing more apoptosis of CAFs and M2 macrophages, reshaping the TME to promote CD8+T cell infiltration. After ATG5 knockdown (autophagy inhibition) in CAFs, the efficacy-enhancing effect of anti-PD-1 therapy was significantly attenuated versus control, confirming CAF autophagy is core to TME regulation. In vitro, anlotinib induced CAF autophagy via AKT/mTOR inhibition; inhibiting CAF autophagy enhanced anlotinib-induced CAF apoptosis and impaired CAFs' ability to recruit M2 macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy inhibition enhances the effects of antiangiogenic TKIs on tumor cells and CAFs and directly or indirectly regulates the TME, which might explain why autophagy inhibition enhances the efficacy of antiangiogenic TKIs combined with anti-PD-1 therapy.",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,21/09/2025

Alpelisib, a small-molecule inhibitor that targets p110-alpha, is a recommended drug for patients with PIK3CA-mutant advanced breast cancer. However, clinical success for PI3K inhibitors has been limited by their narrow therapeutic window. The lipid phosphatase PTEN is a potent tumour suppressor and a major negative regulator of the PI3K pathway. Unsurprisingly, inactivating mutations in PTEN correlate with tumour progression and resistance to PI3K inhibition due to persistent PI3K signalling. Here we demonstrate that PI3K inhibition leads rapidly to the inactivation of PTEN. Using a functional genetic screen we show that this effect is mediated by a USP10-GSK3-B signalling axis, in which USP10 stabilizes GSK3-B resulting in GSK3-B-mediated phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of PTEN. This phosphorylation inhibits PTEN dimerization and thus prevents its activation. Downregulation of GSK3-B or USP10 re-sensitizes PI3K inhibitor resistant breast cancer models and patient derived organoids to PI3K inhibition and induces tumour regression. Our study establishes that enhancing PTEN activity is a new strategy to treat PIK3CA mutant tumours and provides a strong rationale for pursuing USP10 inhibitors in the clinic.",The Journal of clinical investigation,23/09/2025

METHODS: Diagnoses were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112 973 offspring from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we observed a modest association between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.07-1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). The HR for more than 29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95% CI 1.50-3.24). Use for <8 days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.00). Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated with ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 1.71-22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen were similarly associated with ADHD.

Although several first-line treatments exist with mild adverse effects, up to 50% to 60% of patients do not tolerate or respond to them. Ammoxetine, a novel selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, has been found to reduce adverse effects and hepatotoxicity and more potent inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, making it more tolerable and effective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ammoxetine in treating adults with MDD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2 randomized clinical trial was a multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study of ammoxetine treatment in patients with MDD in China. Patients aged 18 to 65 years from 15 study centers were randomized into daily ammoxetine or placebo groups between March 27, 2023, and June 13, 2024, and followed up for 10 weeks. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to 3 treatment groups: ammoxetine 40 mg/d, ammoxetine 60 mg/d, and placebo. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to 8 weeks. Efficacy analyses were performed on both the full-analysis and per-protocol sets using least-squares (LS) mean differences. The safety set analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among 239 enrolled patients (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [10.0] years, 158 female [66.1%]), 80 were randomized to the ammoxetine 60 mg/d group, 80 to the ammoxetine 40 mg/d group, and 79 to the placebo group. In the full-analysis set, both ammoxetine doses led to statistically significant improvements in MADRS total scores at week 8 compared with placebo. The LS mean changes (SE) from baseline were -16.7 (1.3) for ammoxetine 40 mg/d, -16.6 (1.3) for ammoxetine 60 mg/d, and -13.5 (1.3) for placebo. The differences vs placebo were -3.3 (97.3 CI, -6.3 to -0.3) for ammoxetine 40 mg/d and -3.1 (97.3% CI, -6.2 to 0.0) for ammoxetine 60 mg/d. Consistent results were observed in the per-protocol set analysis at week 8 for ammoxetine 40 mg/d (LS mean change, -3.2; 97.3% CI, -6.2 to -0.2) and ammoxetine 60 mg/d (LS mean change, -3.18; 97.3% CI, -6.2 to -0.2), both superior to placebo. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 68 participants (85.0%) receiving ammoxetine 60 mg/d, 63 (78.8%) receiving ammoxetine 40 mg/d, and 48 (60.8%) receiving placebo; most were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated superiority over placebo of ammoxetine treatment at both 40 mg/d and 60 mg/d in patients with MDD. In addition, all doses of ammoxetine were generally well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05762458.",JAMA network open,02/09/2025

CHC and related metal coordination homodimer alkaloids were rapidly synthesized and purified for further pharmacological study. In vitro, CHC significantly inhibited HCT116 and RKO CRC cell growth, induced G1 phase arrest and cell death, and overcame oxaliplatin resistance. In vivo, CHC suppressed colorectal tumor growth in mice at 40 mg/kg without obvious toxic effects.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can now be confirmed when the criteria of dissemination in space are fulfilled with the detection of typical lesions in at least four locations without additional evidence. We recommend appropriate imaging strategies and MRI acquisition protocols for all aspects of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including fat-saturated sequences for detection of symptomatic optic nerve lesions. Diagnostic imaging should always cover the brain and spinal cord and include susceptibility-sensitive sequences for the assessment of the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions, which can be especially helpful in cases when conventional imaging findings are insufficient to establish a diagnosis. We discuss how to handle the diagnosis of radiologically isolated presentations of multiple sclerosis, which are included in the 2024 criteria. We present recommendations for image interpretation and avoidance of misdiagnosis, and extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older people, children, people with vascular comorbidities or migraine, and people living outside Europe and North America.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 55 unaffected fellow eyes of APAC, 48 unaffected fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC, and 52 eyes of control subjects. All patients underwent anterior segment optical coherence tomography imaging. Anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber area, anterior chamber width (ACW), iris thickness (IT), iris curvature, lens vault (LV), and angle parameters including angle-opening distance (AOD750) were measured in qualified images using customized software and compared among the groups using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: Fellow eyes of APAC had the smallest axial length, AOD, anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber area, ACW, and the greatest LV, and IT (P≤0.002 for all), followed by fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC, after adjustment for age, sex, and pupil diameter. IT and curvature were comparable between fellow eyes of phacomorphic AC and controls. Angle parameters had the highest area of the receiver-operator characteristic curve for discrimination of fellow eyes of APAC eyes and phacomorphic AC (0.795, P=0.001 for AOD750).

Increasing attention has been paid to the role of environmental pollutants in EC development. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a significant association between elevated urinary concentrations of bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCPP) and an increased risk of EC. However, the hub genes and underlying mechanisms of BDCPP-induced EC remain poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential targets of BDCPP and EC were retrieved from multiple databases. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the common targets. Enrichment analysis was performed using GO, KEGG, and Reactome databases. Clinical and transcriptomic data of EC patients were downloaded from TCGA. Subsequently, 117 machine learning models were employed to screen for hub genes. A risk score for BDCPP exposure was calculated based on the hub genes. Single-gene gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted on the hub genes and molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinity of BDCPP to the hub genes. RESULTS: We identified 165 potential targets implicated in BDCPP-induced EC. Machine learning pinpointed eight hub genes: PLA2G2A, PLAU, SIRT2, DRD2, GSK3A, THRB, CYP17A1 , and TLR9 . The BDCPP exposure risk score model offers a framework for predicting the prognosis of EC patients with moderate accuracy. Molecular docking revealed the binding potential between BDCPP and hub genes. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles of inflammatory activation, hormonal disruption, altered lipid metabolism, and epigenetic dysregulation in pathogenic mechanisms. Single-gene GSEA further emphasized the critical roles of nucleocytoplasmic transport, polycomb repressive complex, and mRNA surveillance pathway in this process. CONCLUSION: Our study investigated the hub genes and underlying mechanisms of BDCPP-induced EC. The findings not only offer novel insights into the role of environmental pollutants in EC development but also present an analytical framework for elucidating the carcinogenic mechanisms of other environmental chemicals.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",24/09/2025

The high phagocytic activity of M2 macrophages reduces foam cell formation. Their secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines enhances plaque stability, mitigating atherosclerosis progression. Through high-throughput sequencing and multi-omics bioinformatics analysis, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) is identified as a key regulator linking glycogen metabolism to macrophage polarization. The integrated approach combined transcriptomic analysis of human atherosclerotic plaques (GSE57614) with RNA-seq of PPP1R3B-modulated macrophages, revealing its dual role. PPP1R3B induces anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization and maintains energy supply in plaques. Its absence accelerates plaque progression. PPP1R3B regulates M2 macrophage polarization and energy metabolism via phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3), which plays a dual role by activating anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs through the PPAR-γ/PGC-1α/CD206 axis in the nucleus and enhancing glycogenolysis-mediated metabolic activity via the p-GSK-3β/p-PYGL/p-GYS2 axis in mitochondria. STAT3 plays a dual role in metabolic regulation and macrophage phenotype modulation. By orchestrating glycogen metabolic reprogramming, PPP1R3B-induced M2 polarization presents a novel strategy for anti-ASCVD drug development, with significant potential for clinical translation.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",23/09/2025
10.3389/fimmu.2025.1620768,Increased risk of antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with psoriasis: a retrospective cohort study.,"Wang Q, Cui R, Du Y, Wang YH, Wei JC, Dai SM","OBJECTIVES: Psoriasis is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, raising concerns about its potential link to antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). However, evidence on the risk of APS in psoriasis patients remains limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX US Collaborative Networks (2002-2022). Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed to balance demographic variables, comorbidities, and medication use between 288,678 psoriasis and non-psoriasis patients. The univariate Cox proportional hazard model and subgroup analyses were used to estimate the hazard ratio for APS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot the cumulative incidence curves. RESULTS: After matching, each cohort included 288,678 patients. Psoriasis patients exhibited significantly higher APS incidence (1,349 cases vs. 673 in controls; HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.56-1.88). Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) further amplified risk (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.58-2.31). Subgroup analyses identified elevated APS susceptibility in older adults, females, Black/African American individuals, and those with chronic comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are significant risk factors for APS, highlighting the need for targeted screening and management strategies in these populations.",Frontiers in immunology,01/01/2025

During early lipid deposition, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) mediates chronic inflammation and accelerates calcification progression. However, the mechanism still needs to be further explored. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study identified the transcription factor FOXS in human valvular interstitial cells (VICs) as a pivotal regulator in aortic valve calcification. Bulk RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis were conducted to establish that FOXS1 is induced by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in VICs. To elucidate the role of FOXS1 in osteogenic differentiation, small interfering RNA and recombinant adenovirus were utilized to modulate FOXS1 expression in VICs. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed Apoe-/-Foxs1-/- mice served as an in vivo model to investigate the role of FOXS1 in aortic valve calcification. Analysis from bulk RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and western blot indicated significant activation of FOXS1 by oxLDL in VICs, with silencing of FOXS1 inhibiting oxLDL-induced osteogenic differentiation. Deletion of FOXS1 markedly reduced aortic valve calcification in HFD-fed Apoe-/- mice, as shown by decreased calcium deposition in the aortic valve leaflets. RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing were performed to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of FOXS1, uncovering direct interactions with the promoter of BSCL2, which subsequently inhibits the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 via the PPARγ/LXRα axis. The study demonstrated that FOXS1 mediates VICs' cholesterol transport dysfunction through BSCL2, ABCA1, and ABCG1 using Bodipy-cholesterol and showed that intracellular cholesterol accumulation can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, promoting osteogenic differentiation of VICs. Additionally, it was found that IMM-H007 and recombinant BSCL2 could reduce aortic valve calcification both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: We identified that an oxLDL-induced transcription factor FOXS1 inhibits ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression via the BSCL2/PPARγ/LXRα axis and promotes cholesterol transport dysfunction and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in VICs, thereby accelerating the progression of CAVD.",Cardiovascular research,24/09/2025

Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113), a targeted oral peptide that selectively binds the interleukin-23 receptor, compared with both placebo and deucravacitinib in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: The phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 trials, which are being done at 149 sites across 13 countries and 114 sites across 11 countries, respectively, randomly assigned (2:1:2 and 4:1:4, respectively) adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis diagnosed for at least 26 weeks (body-surface-area involvement ≤10%, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] ≤12, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] ≤3) to once-daily oral icotrokinra 200 mg, placebo, or deucravacitinib 6 mg; participants randomly assigned to placebo or deucravacitinib transitioned to icotrokinra at week 16 or week 24, respectively. Coprimary endpoints were proportions of participants achieving IGA 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) with at least a two-grade improvement and at least 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 90) at week 16 with icotrokinra versus placebo. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06143878 (ADVANCE 1) and NCT06220604 (ADVANCE 2), and are ongoing. FINDINGS: ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 enrolled participants from Jan 17, 2024, to May 24, 2024, and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 enrolled participants from March 9, 2024, to June 13, 2024. Participants (ADVANCE 1: 774 of 988 patients screened; ADVANCE 2: 731 of 917 patients screened) were randomly assigned to icotrokinra (n=311 and 322), placebo (n=156 and 82), or deucravacitinib (n=307 and 327). All coprimary endpoints were met in both trials. Higher proportions of icotrokinra-treated versus placebo-treated participants achieved IGA 0 or 1 (ADVANCE 1: 213 [68%] of 311 vs 17 [11%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 58% [50-64]; ADVANCE 2: 227 [70%] of 322 vs seven [9%] of 82, 62% [53-69]; both p<0·0001) and PASI 90 (ADVANCE 1: 171 [55%] of 311 vs six [4%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 51% [44-57]; ADVANCE 2: 184 [57%] of 322 vs one [1%] of 82, 56% [48-62]; both p<0·0001) at week 16. Across studies, adverse event rates to week 16 were 303 (48%) of 632 and 136 (57%) of 237 with icotrokinra and placebo, respectively; the most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (37 [6%] of 632 and 13 [5%] of 237) and upper respiratory tract infection (23 [4%] of 632 and eight [3%] of 237). To week 24, adverse event rates were lower than with icotrokinra (359 [57%] of 632) than deucravacitinib (411 [65%] of 634). INTERPRETATION: Icotrokinra showed superior clinical response rates versus placebo and deucravacitinib in phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis trials, with similar adverse event rates to placebo.

10.1111/liv.70367,Target Trial Emulations of GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists to Reduce Major Adverse Liver Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Henney AE, Riley DR, Anson M, Azmi S, Alam U, Cuthbertson DJ","BACKGROUND: Clinical trials suggest GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) and dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RAs improve metabolic dysfunction associated with steatohepatitis (MASH) in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to compare the estimate of the relative effect of tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide in reducing the risk of major adverse liver outcomes (MALOs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We emulated target trials based on a real-world network of electronic health records (EHRs) from over 150 million patients. Three target trials were emulated, among eligible patients with T2D who had no prior MALO diagnosis, by comparing therapy involving tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide versus DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) therapy. We identified the first-ever diagnosis of MALO occurring within a 2-year follow-up period and compared across the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Cohorts underwent propensity score matching 1:1 for confounders. We performed sensitivity analyses relating to geographical location, combination with metformin, and by treatment adherence. We also performed head-to-head analyses of the incretin-based therapies. RESULTS: After matching, we identified three target trials comprised of 10 165, 56 702, and 8 301 patients treated with tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide, respectively (1:1 with reference patients) for a 2-year period. Tirzepatide (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.40, 0.71]) and semaglutide (HR 0.81 [0.72, 0.90]) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of incident MALO compared with DPP4i, whereas liraglutide was not (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.79, 1.36]). In head-to-head comparisons, tirzepatide was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident MALO compared with liraglutide (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.39, 0.79]), but not semaglutide (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.63, 1.09]). Semaglutide was not associated with a reduced risk compared with liraglutide (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.57, 1.05]). CONCLUSION: Treatment with tirzepatide and, to a lesser extent, semaglutide, in patients with T2D, was associated with a lower incidence of MALO compared with DPP4i after 2 years; largely driven by a reduction in the rates of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. A reduction in MALO was not demonstrated with the use of liraglutide. These findings highlight a comparative benefit of tirzepatide (and semaglutide) versus DPP4i and should prompt more robust, longer-term randomised controlled studies to evaluate their role in preventing MALO in this increasingly prevalent patient population with co-existing T2D and MASLD.",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,01/10/2025

However, standard-of-care diagnostic tests are time-intensive and do not capture the full spectrum of acute leukemia heterogeneity. Here, we developed a framework to classify acute leukemia using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling.

Methylation-based classification matched standard-pathology lineage classification in most cases and revealed heterogeneity in addition to that captured by genetic categories. Using this reference, we developed a neural network (MARLIN; methylation- and AI-guided rapid leukemia subtype inference) for acute leukemia classification from sparse DNA methylation profiles. In retrospective cohorts profiled by nanopore sequencing, high-confidence predictions were concordant with conventional diagnoses in 25 out of 26 cases. Real-time MARLIN classification in patients with suspected acute leukemia provided accurate predictions in five out of five cases, which were typically generated within 2 h of sample receipt. In summary, we present a framework for rapid acute leukemia classification that complements and enhances standard-of-care diagnostics.",Nature genetics,22/09/2025

Fourteen healthy older subjects were randomly allocated in either the RT (n: 6) or control group (n: 8). The RT was composed of 4 sets × 10 repetitions (70-80% 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) in a leg press machine. The time course of vastus lateralis muscle hypertrophy (CSA) was assessed on a weekly basis by mode-B ultrasonography. Leg press muscle strength was assessed by dynamic 1RM test. Our results demonstrated that the RT group increased leg press 1RM by 42% (p ≤ 0.05) after 10 weeks of training. Significant increases in vastus lateralis muscle CSA were observed only after 18 sessions of training (9 weeks; p ≤ 0.05; 7.1%). In conclusion, our training protocol promoted muscle mass accrual in older subjects, and this was only observable after 18 sessions of RT (9 weeks).",Journal of strength and conditioning research,01/01/2016

It is characterized by excessive subchondral bone loss at an early stage and cartilage damage at a later stage. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have attracted widespread attention for their potential role in modulating OA pathology. However, the application of MSC-EVs in TMJOA remains underexplored, and the mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluate the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (hUCMSC-EVs) on TMJOA, with a focus on subchondral bone, and investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms through miRNA sequencing. The results demonstrated that hUCMSC-EVs treatment significantly reduced osteoclast (OC) activity by transferring let-7a-5p, which further suppressed the expression of integrin β3 (ITGβ3) of osteoclasts. In a rat TMJOA model, intra-articular injection of hUCMSC-EVs demonstrated protective effects on both subchondral bone and cartilage, primarily through the suppression of osteoclast activity.

Evaluating the efficacy and safety of adjuvant ribociclib beyond the planned 3-year treatment period is critical for understanding the long-term impact on recurrences. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of adjuvant ribociclib in an exploratory 4-year analysis of the NATALEE (New Adjuvant Trial With Ribociclib [LEE011]) randomized clinical trial, with all patients no longer receiving ribociclib treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This exploratory analysis of an international, open-label, randomized phase 3 trial analyzed adjuvant treatment for premenopausal and postmenopausal women and men with hormone receptor-positive/ERBB2-negative early breast cancer. Eligible patients had anatomic stage IIA (either N0 with additional risk factors or N1 [1-3 axillary lymph nodes]), IIB, or III disease per the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition. The data cutoff date was April 29, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive ribociclib (400 mg once daily, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, over 36 months) plus NSAI (letrozole, 2.5 mg, or anastrozole, 1 mg, once daily continuously for 60 months) or NSAI alone. Men and premenopausal women also received goserelin (3.6 mg once every 28 days administered subcutaneously). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was iDFS, and secondary efficacy end points included distant disease-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. Survival was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Among 5101 patients included in the analysis (median [range] age, 52 [24-90] years; 5081 [99.6%] female), the median follow-up for iDFS was 44.2 months (range, 0-63 months). Ribociclib plus NSAI continued to show iDFS benefit over NSAI alone (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61-0.84), with 3-year iDFS rates of 90.8% vs 88.1% (difference, 2.7 percentage points) and 4-year rates of 88.5% vs 83.6% (difference, 4.9 percentage points). The efficacy benefit was consistent across subgroups and secondary end points. Overall survival data remain immature, although a trend in favor of ribociclib plus NSAI over NSAI alone was observed (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64-1.07). The incidence of adverse events has remained stable. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This exploratory analysis of the NATALEE randomized clinical trial, with a median follow-up beyond the 3-year treatment duration, demonstrated consistent iDFS benefit with ribociclib plus NSAI over NSAI alone.

Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been implicated in kidney disease progression, its specific role and underlying mechanisms in renal fibrosis remain poorly understood. This study aims to investigate these mechanisms by establishing a mouse model of renal fibrosis through unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) combined with a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD. Single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence are performed, along with in vitro experiments involving primary renal macrophages and coculture models. It is demonstrated that NAFLD exacerbates renal fibrosis, as HFD-induced hepatocytes release significant levels of ANGPTL8, which activates renal CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages. These specialized macrophages disrupt linoleic acid metabolism and increase the production of inflammatory cytokines, aggravating renal fibrosis. In addition, CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages promote the activation and proliferation of Th17 cells, which can further contribute to the worsening of renal fibrosis. Thus, the ANGPTL8/PIRB/ALOX5AP axis is a crucial signaling pathway between the liver and kidneys, and CCR2(+)PIRB(+) macrophages play a pivotal role in the progression of NAFLD-induced renal fibrosis.

While current treatment options, primarily surgery and medication, vary with TBI severity, there is no universal therapeutic agent applicable in both surgical and medical contexts. In the present study, exosomes derived from induced neural stem cells (iNSC-Exo) as a versatile therapeutic agent for TBI are investigated using a preclinical murine model. The iNSC-Exo treatment is found to exert therapeutic effects by mediating anti-neuroinflammation and neuroprotection, thereby promoting functional and cognitive recovery in TBI mice. Besides, two clinically inspired administration modalities are established for iNSC-Exo: local delivery and systemic delivery. Their efficacy is enhanced via a novel injectable hydrogel and RVG targeting for systemic delivery, respectively. Finally, the unprecedented single-cell characterization of mouse brain tissue, both pre- and post-iNSC-Exo treatment, confirms that microglia represent the predominant type of cells affected. Two microglial subpopulations (i.e., Microglia_Nrg3 and Microglia_Rarb) are identified with a reduced state of differentiation, and their connectivity with neurons is predicted through activation of the NRXN signaling pathway. Overall, these findings demonstrated that iNSC-Exo offers a versatile and potent treatment platform with clinical potential for TBI management.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025

How running develops, however, is largely unknown. METHODS: We assessed the maturity of running pattern in two very young, typically developing children in a longitudinal design spanning about three years. Leg and trunk 3D kinematics and electromyography collected in six recording sessions, with more than a hundred strides each, entered our analysis. We recorded walking during the first session (the session of the first independent steps of the two toddlers at the age of 11.9 and 10.6 months) and fast walking or running for the subsequent sessions. More than 100 kinematic and neuromuscular parameters were determined for each session and stride. The equivalent data of five young adults served to define mature running. After dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis based on the average pairwise correlation distance to the adult running cluster served as a measure for maturity of the running pattern. RESULTS: Both children developed running. Yet, in one of them the running pattern did not reach maturity whereas in the other it did. As expected, mature running appeared in later sessions (>13 months after the onset of independent walking). Interestingly, mature running alternated with episodes of immature running within sessions. Our clustering approach separated them. DISCUSSION: An additional analysis of the accompanying muscle synergies revealed that the participant who did not reach mature running had more differences in muscle contraction when compared to adults than the other. One may speculate that this difference in muscle activity may have caused the difference in running pattern.",Frontiers in human neuroscience,01/01/2023

METHODS: We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on kidney tissues from lupus nephritis patients and mouse models to investigate transcriptional alterations in glomerular endothelial cells, and validated our findings in two lupus nephritis models: pristane-induced lupus nephritis and MRL/lpr mice. Genetically modified mice and cultured cells were employed to further validate the key discoveries. Additionally, a panel of cytokine stimulations was used to elucidate the underlying causes of glomerular endothelial cell injury in lupus nephritis. RESULTS: Bmpr2 was identified as a critical regulator, showing significant upregulation in glomerular endothelial cells from both lupus nephritis patients and mouse models. Elevated Bmpr2 expression correlated with enhanced glomerular endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and increased expression of adhesion molecules (Vcam1, Icam1). BMPR2 activated SMAD-dependent pathways, leading to the upregulation of downstream targets ID1 and ID3, thereby promoting glomerular endothelial cell hyperactivation. Bmpr2 overexpression amplified glomerular endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas inhibition of ID signaling by DMH2 or endothelial-specific Bmpr2 knockout attenuated these effects. Moreover, targeting BMPR2 signaling reduced the infiltration of CD86+ macrophages into lupus nephritis kidneys. Co-culture experiments confirmed that Bmpr2-activated glomerular endothelial cells promoted macrophage differentiation into an inflammatory phenotype. Complement component C5a was identified as a critical upstream inducer of Bmpr2 in glomerular endothelial cells, and inhibition of C5a signaling with the C5aR1 antagonist PMX-53 effectively suppressed Bmpr2 upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight BMPR2 as a key regulator of glomerular endothelial cell injury and macrophage-mediated inflammation in lupus nephritis. Targeting BMPR2 or its upstream activators, such as C5a, effectively treated and improved lupus nephritis.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,22/09/2025

In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and a combination of in vivo and in vitro models to decode the dynamics of tumor-stroma interactions during human LUAD progression, focusing primarily on adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). We identified a matrix CAF (mCAF) subtype characterized by high THBS2 expression, which was closely associated with poor clinical outcomes, tumor recurrence, and the invasive dynamics of LUAD. Spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that this CAF subpopulation was closely associated with tumor cells, with clear spatial colocalization. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that THBS2 secreted by these mCAFs directly binds to SDC4 on tumor cells, enhancing tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs. This study highlights THBS2+ mCAFs as key regulators of tumor-stroma interactions and identifies the THBS2-SDC4-EMT axis as a potential therapeutic target in LUAD.",Oncogene,19/09/2025

In this clinical perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the published literature on the effect of maternal acetaminophen use in pregnancy on the child's risk of developing attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies included were specifically selected on the basis of the quality and validity of ADHD or ASD outcome definitions. From a total of 56 identified studies, commentaries, and editorials of relevance, we critically reviewed nine studies with original data that satisfied our inclusion criteria and three meta-analyses. Most studies that have reported positive findings are difficult to interpret because they have important biases, notably a high degree of selection bias, variability in selection and adjustment for various potential confounders, and unmeasured familial confounding. When unobserved familial confounding through sibling analysis was controlled for, associations weakened substantially. This suggests that residual confounding from shared genetic and environmental factors may have caused an upward bias in the original observations. According to the current scientific evidence, in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk of childhood ADHD or ASD. The current level of evidence does not warrant changes to clinical guidelines on the treatment of fever or pain in pregnancy. Prospective research designed to account for familial and psychosocial environmental factors related to both maternal use of acetaminophen and children's neurodevelopment should be undertaken.",Obstetrics and gynecology,01/02/2025

Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic considered safe in pregnancy. Recent studies have found an association between acetaminophen and immune system alterations like asthma and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one meta-analysis. We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is urgent to do more research on this association before pregnant women can be cautioned about the precise use of acetaminophen.",Cureus,01/07/2022

This study aims to elucidate molecular differences in response mechanisms of RA patients to csDMARDs through multiomics approach, with particular focus on the role of tryptophan (Trp) in treatment. Plasma, fecal, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected for metabolomics, microbiomics, transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses. Additionally, in vitro/vivo experiments and controlled clinical trial were conducted to validate the findings. Comprehensive analysis revealed significant alterations in Trp-related metabolic profiles, microbiota composition, and immune cells, indicating the role of Trp in modulating therapeutic response to csDMARDs. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Trp significantly inhibited the proliferation of MH7A and PBMCs while reducing the secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that Trp treatment decreased arthritis scores and histological scores in mice. Clinical data further confirmed that dietary supplementation with Trp significantly improved disease activity scores and alleviated inflammatory in RA patients. This study highlights the crucial regulatory role of Trp in RA therapy, providing novel insights for optimizing clinical treatment strategies for RA.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",23/09/2025

However, the feasibility of manipulating tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) reprogramming to influence PNI development remains unclear. Methods: Using in vitro (tumor-DRG co-culture) and in vivo (sciatic nerve injection) models coupled with protein identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and ChIP-seq, the role of steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) is investigated in TAM reprogramming and PNI. SRC-1 is up-regulated in TAMs and promotes PNI by binding to signal transducer and activator of transcription 1(STAT1) to enhance matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12) transcription. SRC-1 knockdown attenuated M2-like characteristics in TAMs, reduced MMP12 secretion, and suppressed PNI. Importantly, blocking the SRC-1/STAT1/MMP12 axis (using SRC-1-KO TAMs or MMP12 inhibitors) attenuated PNI progression in vivo. SRC-1 reprograms TAMs via STAT1-mediated MMP12 activation to facilitate PNI. Targeting SRC-1 disrupts this axis and presents a novel therapeutic strategy against PNI in pancreatic cancer.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",23/09/2025

One promising approach involves engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting MSLN (TCR(MSLN)) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to treatment with antibody alone or TCR(MSLN) with singlet or doublet antibody combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR(MSLN) T cells treated with the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the standard first-line therapy for advanced HCC, but long-term use often leads to drug resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has emerged as a crucial target in cancer therapy, showing potential to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis in HCC cells and that ferroptosis plays a significant role in the development of sorafenib resistance. However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance remains poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Our study focuses on the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance in HCC. Using the GSE109211 dataset, we identified differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with sorafenib resistance. Notably, these genes stratified sorafenib-resistant HCC patients into distinct subgroups with different drug sensitivities, immune cell infiltrations, and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Through machine learning algorithms, three hub genes (ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1) were identified to be closely associated with sorafenib resistance. A novel ferroptosis-related signature comprising these genes emerged as a robust diagnostic model, validated by ROC curve analysis, for predicting sorafenib resistance in HCC patients. Furthermore, experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1 expressions in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, with sorafenib treatment altering their expression profiles. Knockdown of ULK1 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells potently enhanced sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating sorafenib resistance. Our findings not only identify pivotal ferroptosis-related genes as diagnostic biomarkers for sorafenib resistance but also provide insights into the role of ferroptosis in modulating sorafenib responsiveness. This study offers a promising strategy to overcome sorafenib resistance and improve patient outcomes in HCC treatment, highlighting the potential of ferroptosis-targeted therapies in cancer management.",International immunopharmacology,21/09/2025

Here, we demonstrate that NR3C1 acts as a key regulator of early postnatal astrocyte development, shaping long-term immune responses in mice. Through integrative analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and long-range chromatin interactions, we identify 55 stage-specific TFs, with NR3C1 uniquely associated with early postnatal maturation. Although mice lacking astrocytic NR3C1 exhibit no detectable developmental abnormalities, these mice display heightened susceptibility to exacerbated immune responses following adult-onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Many of the dysregulated EAE response genes are linked to candidate cis-regulatory elements altered by early NR3C1 loss, driving exacerbated inflammatory responses. Notably, only NR3C1 depletion during early, but not late, astrocyte development induces long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming that primes astrocytic immune responses.",Nature communications,22/09/2025

FOLFIRI-resistant models showed transcriptional upregulation of innate immunity and mitochondrial metabolism genes, together with reduced expression of the DNA polymerase POLD1. Sensitive counterparts exhibited a BRCAness-like phenotype with genomic scars of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, not caused by genetic or epigenetic loss of HR genes but by low abundance of the RAD51 recombinase. In tumoroids, forced RAD51 overexpression attenuated HR deficiency-related scars and chemotherapy-induced damage, while HR inhibition through ATM blockade enhanced drug sensitivity.

We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label study with blinded assessment of the end point in 4728 Japanese hypertensive patients (mean age: 63.8 years; mean body mass index: 24.6 kg/m(2)). Patients were followed for an average of 3.2 years. Blood pressure was well controlled with both treatment-based regimens (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure: 136.1/77.3 mm Hg for candesartan-based regimens and 134.4/76.7 mm Hg for amlodipine-based regimens after 3 years). Primary cardiovascular events occurred in 134 patients with both the candesartan- and amlodipine-based regimens. The 2 treatment-based regimens produced no significant differences in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in the high-risk Japanese hypertensive patients (hazard ratio: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.28; P=0.969). In each primary end point category, there was no significant difference between the 2 treatment-based regimens. New-onset diabetes occurred in fewer patients taking candesartan (8.7/1000 person-years) than in those taking amlodipine (13.6/1000 person-years), which resulted in a 36% relative risk reduction (hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43 to 0.97; P=0.033).

Hepatitis B virus infection is the primary cause of liver fibrosis. Antiviral drugs, e.g., entecavir, are widely used to treat liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Additionally, Chinese patent medicines, such as Biejiajian Pill (BJP), Liuwei Wuling Tablet (LWT), Fufang Biejia Ruangan Tablet (FFT), Fuzheng Huayu Capsule (FZC), and Anluo Huaxian Pill (AHP), demonstrate therapeutic effects. However, there is still insufficient evidence-based agreement on the most effective therapies and how they work. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the most effective Chinese patent medicines for treating liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by combining network meta-analysis and network pharmacology. It also summarises and evaluates the potential mechanisms of effective treatment methods based on published clinical research data. The aim is to provide scientific evidence for clinical decision-making. Finally, these results were verified through experiments. The aim is to provide a scientific basis for clinical decision-making. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of eight databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu Database (VIP), and Wanfang) for studies published up to April 2025. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical outcomes such as Hyaluronic Acid (HA), Laminin (LN), Type IV Collagen (IV-C), Type III Procollagen (PC-III), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), and Total Bilirubin (TBIL) were analyzed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using network pharmacology, with core genes identified via CytoHubba in CytoScape 3.10.0. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Next, we validated these predictions using in vivo experiments, observing pathological changes through HE Staining, Masson's Trichrome Staining, Picro Sirius Red Staining, and Immunohistochemistry, and performing protein expression analysis using Western blotting. RESULTS: A total of 380 studies involving 37,380 patients, were included. Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) and Rank 1 probability were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of each prescription. For liver fibrosis, AHP was the most effective, followed by LWT, FZC, BJP, and FFT. In cirrhosis treatment, LWT was the most effective, followed by AHP, FZC, BJP, and FFT. Combined with network pharmacology analyses revealed that AHP and LWT might play a role in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by regulating targets such as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), Protein kinase B (AKT1), etc. Animal experiments have shown that Chinese patent medicines such as LWT and AHP can significantly improve liver damage in mice and reduce the levels of Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA), Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β), Fibronectin (FN), STAT3, and MMP9 in the CCL(4) group, while increasing the expression and content of AKT1. CONCLUSION: AHP and LWT are the most effective treatments for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively according to current network meta-analysis.

However, there is limited knowledge about their effects on bone quality. We examined whether lifestyle intervention can preserve or enhance bone quality, despite reductions in bone mineral density. METHODS: The Lifestyle Intervention to Improve Bone Quality (LIMB-Q) study was a randomised controlled trial conducted at Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center (Houston, TX, USA) including older adults (aged 65-85 years) with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned to receive either an intensive lifestyle intervention (intensive lifestyle group, consisting of weight management plus exercise training) or healthy lifestyle (healthy lifestyle group, consisting of educational sessions on healthy diets). The co-primary outcomes were 12-month changes in (1) distal tibia cortical thickness, measured using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT, and (2) hip bone strength (failure load), assessed via finite element analysis of CT scans. The primary endpoint was analysed by intention to treat (all randomly assigned patients). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03329963 (completed). FINDINGS: Of 138 participants assessed for eligibility in person between Nov 9, 2017, and Nov 8, 2021, 120 were included in this study (mean age 71·4 years [SD 4·6]; 63 [53%] male and 57 [47%] female). At 12 months, weight loss was greater in the intensive lifestyle group than in the healthy lifestyle group (-11·6 kg [SE 0·5] vs -1·2 kg [0·5]). No group differences were noted in the change in distal tibia cortical thickness between the intensive lifestyle group (-0·013 mm [SE 0·026]) and the healthy lifestyle group (-0·002 mm [0·025]; between-group difference 0·027 [95% CI -0·066 to 0·120], p=0·40). The change in hip failure load at 12 months did not differ between the intensive lifestyle group (13 N [SE 25]) and the healthy lifestyle group (3 N [26]; between-group difference -6.9 N [95% CI -108 to 95], p=0·89). Exercise-related adverse events in the intensive lifestyle group included a small number of musculoskeletal events (falls [one participant], neck pain [two], and foot, shoulder, back, and leg pain [one each]).

Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) as a key regulator in hepatic lipid metabolism and MASLD progression. We show that USP2 expression is significantly upregulated in liver tissues from MASLD patients and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse models. Usp2 knockout or pharmacological inhibition alleviates hepatic steatosis and improves systemic metabolic parameters both in vivo and in vitro. Strikingly, hepatocyte-targeted GalNAc-conjugated siRNA against Usp2 markedly attenuates MASLD in mouse models, highlighting therapeutic potential. Mechanistically, USP2 directly interacts with and stabilizes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) by removing K48-linked ubiquitin chains at lysine 161 within its DNA-binding domain, thereby preventing proteasomal degradation and enhancing its transcriptional activity. This USP2-PPARγ axis promotes hepatic lipid accumulation and drives MASLD progression. Our findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism in MASLD pathogenesis and suggest that USP2 may represent a promising and druggable therapeutic target for metabolic liver disease.",Cell death and differentiation,24/09/2025

It is estimated that between 6000 to 8000 distinct rare diseases affect up to 6% of the total EU population. Therefore, these conditions can be considered rare if taken individually but they affect a significant proportion of the European population when considered as a single group. Several initiatives have been undertaken at international, European and national level to tackle public health as well as research issues related to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of these diseases. The development of innovative and effective medical products for their diagnosis and treatment is frequently hampered by several factors, including the limited knowledge of their natural history, the difficulties in setting up clinical studies due to the limited numbers of patients affected by a specific disease, the weak interest of sponsors due to the restricted market opportunities. Therefore, incentives and other facilitations have been adopted in many parts of the world, including in the EU, in order to facilitate the development and commercialization of diagnostic tools and treatments devoted to rare diseases.

The mean value of VAS after using prescribed treatment in both evaluated groups on all days was significantly different such that the VAS values were lower for PG flower tablets than Triadent (p value < 0.05). The size of oral lesions in participants who used PG flower tablets was significantly less than those who used Triadent on all evaluation days (p value < 0.05) except on Day 1 (p value = 0.29). The descending slope of VAS from Days 1 to 6 for both Triadent and PG flower tablet users was significant and noticeable. (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the result of this study, both P. granatum flower tablet and Triadent are useful in reducing the size, period of healing, and VAS of patients with RAS, but the PG flower tablet is more effective.",Clinical and experimental dental research,01/08/2024

Twenty-one adults with obesity (18 female and 3 male; 46 ± 2 years; 35.0 ± 0.9 kg/m2) completed a 3-month supervised weight loss and exercise training intervention. Insulin sensitivity was measured using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and basal and insulin-stimulated vastus lateralis biopsies were collected pre- and postintervention. After the intervention, body weight and body fat decreased (11 ± 1% and 9 ± 1%, respectively), while VO2 peak and insulin sensitivity increased (14 ± 3% and 68 ± 14%, respectively). Lipidomics revealed reduced sarcolemmal and nuclear triglycerides, with unchanged whole-muscle triglycerides. Whole-muscle diacylglycerols increased because of increased nuclear 1,2-diacylglycerols without PKCε, PKCθ, or PKCδ activation. Whole-muscle sphingolipid levels increased because of cytosolic accumulation. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing showed altered IMAT cellular composition, including increased fibro-adipogenic progenitors, vascular cells, and macrophages, and decreased preadipocytes. Bulk muscle RNA sequencing indicated upregulation of genes related to muscle remodeling and cellular respiration, and there were changes in the relationship between nuclear diacylglycerols and gene expression postintervention. These findings dissociate improvements in insulin sensitivity from total muscle diacylglycerol and sphingolipid levels and highlight roles for subcellular lipid redistribution and IMAT remodeling in insulin sensitization. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: Evaluation of subcellular fractionated muscle revealed decreases in sarcolemmal and nuclear triglycerides and increases in nuclear diacylglycerols and cytosolic sphingolipids postintervention. Weight loss revealed alteration in the cellular composition of intermuscular adipose tissue and upregulation of genes related to muscle remodeling and cellular respiration. These findings dissociate improvements in insulin sensitivity from total muscle 1,2-diacylglycerol and sphingolipid levels and highlight roles of intermuscular adipose tissue remodeling for enhanced insulin sensitivity.",Diabetes,22/09/2025

Strategies to overcome resistance remain of crucial importance. Oncolytic viruses offer a promising approach, with the unique ability to selectively replicate within (and to destroy) cancer cells, remodel the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and stimulate antitumour immunity. Interest in the potential of oncolytic viruses has grown steadily over the past two decades, fuelled by advances in cancer immunology and viral engineering. However, clinical translation has not kept pace, and although a plethora of promising new constructs have entered clinical testing, several barriers continue to restrict widespread clinical implementation.

However, the mechanistic link between SPOP mutations and cellular energy stress remains inadequately explored. In this study, we demonstrate that ULK1 expression is positively correlated with both loss-of-function mutations in SPOP and the upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 in human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, SPOP mutations induce the upregulation of TRIM24, which subsequently binds to ULK1 and catalyzes its non-degradative K27-linked polyubiquitylation. This post-translational modification enhances the stability of ULK1, facilitating cellular adaptation to energy stress and consequently promoting prostate cancer progression. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of TRIM24 using TRIM24-PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting chimera) effectively suppressed tumor growth in mice bearing SPOP-mutant prostate cancer cells. Collectively, these findings elucidate a pivotal role of SPOP mutations in modulating energy stress responses via TRIM24-mediated ULK1 ubiquitylation and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting TRIM24 in SPOP-mutant prostate cancers.",Cell death and differentiation,20/09/2025

However, exosomes undergo rapid clearance following systemic administration, limiting their therapeutic potential because of insufficient retention and sustained release. In this study, an innovative hydrogel-mediated delivery platform encapsulating aminoethyl anisamide (AEAA)-functionalized exosomes was developed to mitigate hepatic fibrosis. By synthesizing a hydrogel (CMC-OD/TA-Fe(III), Gel) composed of carboxymethyl chitosan, oxidized dextran, and iron tannate, and then encapsulating umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes functionalized by AEAA (AEAA-Exos), we implanted this Gel/AEAA-Exos into mice with hepatic fibrosis by intraperitoneal injection to evaluate the therapeutic effect of the hydrogel. The hydrogel had favorable physical properties, optimal biocompatibility, and a sustained-release profile. And Gel/AEAA-Exos system significantly reduced oxidative stress and alleviated hepatic fibrosis. Additionally, RNA-seq revealed that the Gel/AEAA-Exos system ameliorates hepatic fibrogenesis mainly by modulating oxidative stress, collagen deposition, and inflammatory cascade in liver tissues.

A deeper understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis metabolism could uncover specific vulnerabilities and inform the development of new treatments. Sulfur, essential for bacterial growth and survival, fuels key pathways including redox buffering and coenzyme production. Although previous studies suggest that M. tuberculosis utilizes various substrates to meet its sulfur requirements, the primary sources of sulfur exploited during in vivo infection remain unclear. Here, we reveal that M. tuberculosis acquires inorganic sulfate through the SubI-CysTWA transporter during macrophage infection. Using nanoSIMS (high spatial resolution Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) analysis, we observed significant sulfate-derived (33)S enrichment in intracellular bacteria, correlating with metabolic activity. Deletion of subI abolished sulfate uptake, impairing bacterial growth in vitro and reducing M. tuberculosis survival in murine macrophages and lungs of infected mice. Finally, our data demonstrate that sulfate acquisition is essential for maintaining mycobacterial redox balance and resisting nitrosative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, unlike many intracellular pathogens, M. tuberculosis depends on an energetically costly inorganic sulfate assimilation pathway to survive in the nutrient-limited host environment. These findings challenge prior assumptions that organic reduced sulfur sources, such as methionine, fuel M. tuberculosis sulfur metabolism during infection. Since animal cells lack a sulfate assimilation pathway, uncovering the critical role of SubI-CysTWA-mediated sulfate import in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis highlights this pathway as a promising pathogen-specific therapeutic target. Targeting this system could either directly impair M. tuberculosis survival during infection or sensitize bacilli to antibiotic-induced oxidative stress by disrupting redox homeostasis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

Atherosclerotic plaque macrophages are key players at the site of disease, where metabolic reprogramming dictates the progression of pathogenesis. Here we show that reduced macrophage glutaminase activity is related to glutaminase (GLS)-1 and not GLS2 expression. While glutamine synthetase serves as a metabolic rheostat controlling nutrient flux into cells in vitro, macrophage restorative functions in the context of atherosclerosis relies more heavily on glutamine influx. Enhanced glutamine flux is largely mediated by the SLC7A7 exchanger in macrophages: Slc7a7-silenced macrophages have reduced glutamine influx and GLS1-dependent glutaminolysis, impeding downstream signalling involved in macrophage restorative functions. In vivo, macrophage-specific deletion of Slc7a7 accelerates atherosclerosis in mice with more complex necrotic core composition. Finally, cell-intrinsic regulation of glutaminolysis drives macrophage metabolic and transcriptional rewiring in atherosclerosis by diverting exogenous Gln flux to balance remodelling and restorative functions. Thus, we uncover a role of SLC7A7-dependent glutamine uptake upstream of glutaminolysis in atherosclerotic plaque development and stability.",Nature metabolism,01/09/2025

Strategically positioned at the brain-vasculature interface, PVMs sense the redox status, modulate immunity, and potentially influence ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death increasingly implicated in AD. However, whether the involvement of PVMs in AD pathology specifically entails mechanisms related to the crosstalk between immunometabolism and ferroptosis, and the precise molecular pathways linking PVMs, immunometabolism, and ferroptosis to AD, remains unclear. METHODS: We first obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data of PVMs from AD patients and control subjects via the GEO database, identified Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), and applied Mendelian Randomization (MR), with robustness validated via leave-one-out analysis to pinpoint key genes among the DEGs with causal relevance to AD. Next, we identified ferroptosis-related genes within these key genes and examined their associations with immune cell infiltration and immunometabolic signaling pathways, while also predicting their regulatory transcription factors to inform potential therapeutic strategies. RESULTS: We identified 149 DEGs in PVMs between AD and control groups, which were primarily enriched in immune and metabolic pathways. MR analysis established eight genes (ACSL1, SPATA6, RAB31, NIBAN1, HDAC4, GRAMD1B, GCC2, and DENND3) as causally and negatively associated with AD risk (IVW analysis identified all P < 0.05, with robustness confirmed by leave-one-out analysis), with ACSL1 being recognized as a known ferroptosis driver. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in monocyte and neutrophil proportions in AD, with DENND3 identified as the sole gene significantly correlated with monocyte abundance. The Key genes demonstrated distinct associations with immunometabolic pathways: GRAMD1B expression was positively associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, whereas both NIBAN1 and SPATA6 showed enrichment in cells with high Notch signaling activity. ACSL1 exhibited robust associations with multiple pathways implicated in ferroptosis, including the IL-6/JAK/STAT3, interferon-γ, TGF-β, bile acid metabolism, and cholesterol homeostasis pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms that mediate the crosstalk between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Transcription factor analysis highlighted shared regulation by CEBPD and the SP1/2/3/4 family, indicating convergent transcriptional control of these genes. CONCLUSION: This study identifies eight key genes in PVMs that may protect against AD through mechanisms involving the interplay between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Our findings provide novel insights into the function of PVMs in AD pathophysiology and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this devastating neurodegenerative disease.",Current neuropharmacology,18/09/2025

We aimed to evaluate the associations of prenatal and postnatal exposures to acetaminophen with behavioral problems in children at age 11 years, using behavioral measures reported by parents and children. We studied 40,934 mother-child pairs from the Danish National Birth Cohort enrolled during 1996-2002. Parent-reported and child-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) responses were collected during the 11-year follow-up. We estimated risk ratios for behavioral problems including total difficulties as well as internalizing or externalizing behaviors following prenatal (during pregnancy) or postnatal (within the first 18 months after birth) acetaminophen exposure. Parent-reported and child-reported SDQ scores were moderately correlated; higher for externalizing (r = 0.59) than internalizing (r = 0.49) behaviors. Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with 10%-40% higher risks for total difficulties and internalizing and externalizing problems based on parent- or child-reported SDQ, with the association being stronger for greater cumulative weeks of acetaminophen use. Postnatal exposure was associated with 16%-19% higher risks for parent-reported internalizing behaviors, but the associations were weak or null for child-reported scores except for prosocial behavior.

The role of diet in these diseases is not well understood due to confounding factors in observational studies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to clarify the causal relationships between dietary intake and pancreatic diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS: A two-sample MR approach was employed, utilizing genetic data from the UK Biobank for dietary exposures and the FinnGen consortium for pancreatic disease outcomes. Genetic variants were selected as instrumental variables (IVs) to assess the impact of 26 dietary components on acute and chronic pancreatitis, as well as pancreatic cancer. Meta-analyses were performed to validate findings across datasets, and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses assessed the independent effects of dietary factors. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that dried fruit intake was protective against both acute (OR = 0.396, p = 0.028) and chronic pancreatitis (OR = 0.289, p < 0.001). Conversely, red wine (OR = 1.559, p = 0.039) and bread (OR = 2.244, p = 0.044) were linked to increased acute pancreatitis risk. Pork was associated with chronic pancreatitis (OR = 3.652, p = 0.048), while oily fish intake correlated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.699, p = 0.046). Meta-analyses confirmed dried fruit protective association with acute pancreatitis. MVMR analyses indicated independent causal relationships between dried fruit and both acute and chronic pancreatitis. CONCLUSION: This study showed the protective effects of dried fruit and salad/raw vegetables against pancreatic diseases, while red wine, bread, and pork may elevate risk.

This gap limits the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of effective early detection methods. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has merged as a key role in CRC pathogenesis. But research on mRNA methylation in CRC remains sparse. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to address the roles of m6A modifications in CRC and to understand how mRNA methylation contributes to CRC development and progression. METHODS: We obtained a comprehensive mapping of altered m6 peaks within mRNAs using Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (MeRIP-seq) from 34 CRC samples and 34 adjacent normal tissue samples and dissect molecular mechanisms of identified key CRC gene(s). By integrating these data, we identified differentially expressed mRNAs with altered m6A levels. Further analysis identified 119 overlapping peaks with both significantly altered RNA methylation and expression levels. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between m6A-regulated gene expression and Immune infiltrates using CRC patient-derived PBMC samples. Additionally, we established a subcutaneous xenograft tumor model to explore the role of SIM2 in CRC progression. RESULTS: Our comprehensive analysis of 68 fresh-frozen CRC samples identified 119 overlapping m6A peaks across 77 genes, classified based on m6A and mRNA expression changes. Survival analyses revealed a signature of m6A-modified genes with prognostic potential. These methylated genes were significant associated with immune cell profiles in the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoints regulation, highlighting m6A as a promising immunotherapeutic target for CRC. SIM2 emerged as a key candidate, exhibiting elevated m6A and RNA expression levels in tumors and Macrophage M2 cells.

Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant glycosylation disrupts immune homeostasis, activates microglia, and promotes the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses. In addition, the inflammatory microenvironment can further dysregulate glycosylation patterns, creating a vicious cycle that amplifies disease pathology. Although the regulatory role of glycosylation in neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases has been recognized, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This review systematically examines the complex crosstalk between glycosylation and neuroinflammation, with a particular focus on the critical roles of glycosylation in key neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Current methods are hampered by the rarity of individual T cell clones and limited applicability to monitor both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted and MHC class II-restricted responses, hence insufficiently reflecting the entire antigen-reactive repertoire of a patient. To obtain broad and deep insight into polyclonal, antigen-specific TCR repertoires, we developed the 'epitope-specific expansion culture with subsequent identification of TCRs' (ESPEC-SUIT) assay to identify and track antigen-specific TCRs. METHODS: In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with (vaccine-targeted) neoantigens was verified in cytokine secretion assays and read-out by TCRβ repertoire sequencing (TCRseq). Candidate antigen-reactive clonotypes were defined by specific expansion in cultures stimulated with relevant antigen, followed by TCR cloning and validation in co-cultures of TCR transgenic effector cells and peptide-presenting targets. Using TCRseq information, candidate and validated clonotypes were traced and characterized in bulk and single-cell repertoire sequencing data of longitudinally collected blood samples and tumor tissue. RESULTS: In a cohort of 32 patients with cancer, we demonstrate that ESPEC-SUIT supports strong, robust and reproducible expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in response to various antigens. TCRseq revealed highly polyclonal neoepitope-specific T cell responses, which can be further characterized with respect to cross-reactivity, affinity or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction. In a subcohort of 10 patients, we selected 341 ESPEC-SUIT-derived TCRs for cloning and in vitro functional validation from >2000 candidates and confirmed antigen-reactivity for >75%. We exemplify the usefulness of this TCR discovery method for downstream analysis in neoepitope vaccinated patients with glioma, where we found longitudinal changes in candidate TCR frequencies in blood mirroring antigen-specific ex vivo Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISpot) responses. Furthermore, up to 67% of candidates could be detected in on-treatment brain tumor tissue and exhibited gene expression signatures overlapping with clonotypes of confirmed specificity to the vaccine antigen. CONCLUSION: ESPEC-SUIT provides unprecedented insight into highly polyclonal, antigen-specific T cell responses and enables discovery of large numbers of TCRs for a given antigen.

It has contributed to numerous obesity-related comorbidities, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and insulin-resistant diabetes. MASLD is diagnosed when there is substantial fat accumulation concomitant with five additional diagnostic criteria. If untreated, MASLD may progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, conditions that can be life-threatening in the final stages. Nonetheless, the development and progression of MASLD are complex, and its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Typically, during fasting, adipose tissue releases fatty acids, which the liver subsequently uptakes for gluconeogenesis. However, this process, along with many others, is impaired in the liver and adipose tissue of individuals with MASLD. This review provides comprehensive details on the mechanisms underlying adiposity and insulin resistance associated with MASLD. We discuss the canonical pathways that promote lipogenesis and insulin sensitivity in the liver and adipose tissues, including bile acids, bilirubin, fatty acids, inflammation, de novo lipogenesis, oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), and metabolism of fructose. The scope of the review is expanded to encompass biological responses to fasting and feeding, as well as their effects on fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity in these tissues. Additionally, the review elaborates on critical molecular mechanisms regulating MASLD progression, including hepatic insulin clearance, insulin degradation, bilirubin metabolism, nerve innervation, and the roles of cytokines and adipokines.

Spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a specific subpopulation of microglia, rod-shaped microglia, with a distinct morphology and direct response to cortical hyperactivity. Rod-shaped microglia predominantly interacted with neuronal dendrites and remodeled excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate motor cortical hyperactivity. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) deficiency led to a marked reduction of rod-shaped microglia accompanied by increased neuronal activity in rNLS8 mice. Together, our results suggest that rod-shaped microglia play a neuroprotective role by attenuating cortical hyperexcitability in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.",Immunity,19/09/2025

The emerging picture highlights different pathways attributed to each process: the record-breaking advanced age is manifested by telomere attrition, abnormal B cell population, and clonal hematopoiesis, whereas absence of typical age-associated diseases is associated with rare European-population genetic variants, low inflammation levels, a rejuvenated bacteriome, and a younger epigenome. These findings provide a fresh look at human aging biology, suggesting biomarkers for healthy aging, and potential strategies to increase life expectancy.

Conventional therapies are hindered by systemic toxicity, drug resistance, and ineffective targeting of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as promising tools in oncology, offering unique plasmonic properties, high biocompatibility, and the ability to be engineered for multifunctional applications. Recent advancements include sustainable biogenic synthesis methods, precision targeting through ligands, aptamers, and peptides, and the development of theranostic platforms that integrate multimodal imaging with controlled drug and gene delivery. Additionally, AuNPs are being combined with therapies like photothermal-immunotherapy to remodel the TME, enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This review explores AuNP applications in cancer detection, diagnosis, and therapy, focusing on targeted drug/gene delivery to overcome chemoresistance, advanced biosensing tools for early detection, hybrid nanocarrier designs for TME penetration, and combinatorial platforms for integrating photodynamic, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. It also addresses key translational barriers, such as protein corona dynamics, long-term biodistribution concerns, and the scalability of green synthesis methods. To facilitate clinical adoption, it emphasizes the need for GMP-compatible manufacturing, personalized nanomedicine through computational design, and standardized safety assessments.

Here, this is demonstrated that oral exposure to 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) accelerates tumor initiation and metastasis in a murine triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) model, without affecting primary tumor growth. PS-NPs do not directly alter TNBC cell behavior in vitro but induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by Alloprevotella enrichment and elevated systemic glutamate levels, both identified as key mediators of PS-NPs-driven tumor promotion. Moreover, PS-NPs enhanced platelet activation, evidenced by increased aggregation, microthrombus formation at metastatic sites, and upregulation of CD36 and Serpine1. Collectively, these findings uncover a synergistic mechanism whereby oral PS-NPs promote TNBC progression via a gut microbiota-derived metabolite-platelet axis, establishing an unrecognized link between environmental nanoplastic exposure and cancer progression, and highlighting potential therapeutic targets for intervention.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025

However, therapeutic resistance to TMZ frequently arises, partly attributed to autophagy, as demonstrated by analysis of clinical glioblastoma specimens. Through screening of mulberry metabolites, a bioactive small molecule, Sanggenol L (SL) is identified, which inhibits glioblastoma growth and blocks autophagy flux, thereby markedly enhancing TMZ chemosensitivity when delivered via a liposome-based system. Mechanistically, SL is found to suppress mitophagy by promoting ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of OPTN. Moreover, the first evidence that SL upregulates TRIM16 expression is presented, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for OPTN degradation in glioblastoma. TRIM16 depletion or OPTN overexpression partially abrogated SL-induced suppression of autophagy and apoptosis in GBM cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that SL enhances TMZ sensitivity by disrupting autophagy and inducing apoptosis through TRIM16-mediated OPTN degradation.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025

Disruption of energy metabolism and subsequent inflammation driven by oxidative stress constitute significant barriers to functional recovery. Proper distribution and function preservation of mitochondria are essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and modulating the inflammatory response during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. Accumulating evidence indicates that both dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments and functional mitochondria undergo intracellular and intercellular transmission, significantly influencing stroke outcomes. The review details two contrasting mitochondrial processes in ischemic stroke: the release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments into the cytoplasm or extracellular space and the entry of functional mitochondria into damaged cells, which plays a dual role: friend or foe. The release of dysfunctional fragments activates downstream pattern recognition receptors, including the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes pathway, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3/absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome, and Toll-like receptors, triggering inflammatory cascades within the neurovascular unit and initiating cell death pathways contributing to cerebral injury. In contrast, the transfer of functional mitochondria plays a protective role by attenuating oxidative stress, preserving mitochondrial quality control, restoring neuronal energy metabolism, inhibiting apoptosis, and maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity. Therapeutic approaches that inhibit the release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments, enhance functional mitochondria transfer, or apply mitochondrial transplantation offer significant potential for improving outcomes in ischemic stroke.",Redox biology,20/09/2025

Here, patients achieving a partial response (PR) after 2 cycles continued daratumumab, otherwise lenalidomide or bortezomib was added. This strategy resulted in an overall response rate of 97% and low rates of adverse events, with 37% of patients able to continue daratumumab monotherapy. Importantly, we found that higher CD38 expression, plasma cell gene expression programming, and an activated iTME were associated with patients who were able to continue daratumumab therapy alone. In contrast, patients requiring the addition of lenalidomide or bortezomib had increased expression of adhesion, TNF signaling, KRAS signaling, and B cell programs as well as an immunosuppressed iTME. Tracking of clonal dynamics illustrated the selection of subclones enriched for de novo resistance gene expression programs after only two cycles of daratumumab monotherapy. Upon relapse, daratumumab refractory MM cells were characterized by the expansion of pre-existing minor subclones with mixed transcriptomic programs containing the plasma cell phenotype with decreased CD38 and maintenance of resistance programs, suggesting development of acquired resistance involves an uncoupling of transcriptional programs present in therapy naïve tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of response-adapted daratumumab treatment and describe critical biomarkers of single-agent daratumumab sensitivity in vulnerable, therapy naïve MM patients.

Although aging and obesity are both associated with cognitive decline, it remains unclear how they interact to affect cognitive function across the lifespan and how brain function might mediate their relationship with cognition. Our previous findings and other studies have shown that membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP/MMP14), which increases with age, regulates energy homeostasis. Inhibiting MT1-MMP improves insulin sensitivity, reduces body fat, and lowers serum cholesterol. Here, we demonstrate that MT1-MMP links neuroinflammation to cognitive decline in aging and obesity. Inflammatory responses in the brain increase MT1-MMP activation in the hippocampus of both mice and humans. Activation of hippocampal MT1-MMP alone can trigger cognitive decline and synaptic impairment independently of neuroinflammation. Conversely, ablation of MT1-MMP in the hippocampus reverses cognitive decline and improves synaptic plasticity in aging and obesity. Pharmacological inhibition of MT1-MMP, through an orally administered brain-penetrant inhibitor or targeted delivery of a neutralizing antibody to the hippocampus, improves memory and learning in aged and obese mice without toxicity. Mechanistically, MT1-MMP proteolytically inactivates G-protein-coupled receptor 158 (GPR158), a hippocampal receptor for osteocalcin (OCN) that is important for the maintenance of cognitive integrity, thus suppressing the ability of the OCN-GPR158 axis to promote cognition in aging and obesity. These findings suggest a new mechanism underlying hippocampal dysfunction and reveal the potential for treating multiple age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, with a single MT1-MMP-blocking agent.",Cell discovery,23/09/2025

Therefore, it is crucial to identify the etiology of these diseases and implement targeted preventive, diagnostic, and treatment measures to address the existing shortage of medical resources. Lipids are integral components of biological membranes. They not only function in energy storage and maintaining cell structure but also play a pivotal role in intercellular communication and signal transmission. Hence, lipids may hold significant implications in the pathogenesis and progression of the aforementioned disorders. METHODS: Utilizing two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) in this investigation, the IEU OpenGWAS database was analyzed to explore the potential causal association between 159 lipids and the mentioned conditions, with sensitivity analysis being performed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained through data analysis of these three diseases in the GEO database, followed by enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicated a potential causal association between the onset and progression of these disorders and 20 lipids categorized into six groups, which include sterol esters (SEs), ceramides (Cer), phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and triacylglycerol (TAG). Furthermore, these lipids were found to regulate biological processes and pathways associated with endocytosis, synaptic vesicular circulation, signal release, MAPK signaling pathway, PI3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway, dopaminergic synapses, and malaria infection. It is worth noting that based on the comprehensive scores of protein interactions in the STRING database, as well as their connectivity and association strength with other proteins in the network, heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSPB1), which is closely related to lipids and has a relatively close relationship with diseases, was identified as a key protein for AD. Similarly, RAB3A was identified as a key protein for PD. CD160 serves as the key protein of EP. CONCLUSION: This study, by combining MR with bioinformatics analysis, discovered the potential lipid-based biological processes, pathways, and biomarkers of AD, PD, and EP, respectively, suggesting new therapeutic targets for us, deepening our understanding of the mechanisms of neurological diseases, and providing support for future clinical interventions.",Annals of human genetics,24/09/2025

The aim of this study was to map the distributions of synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and other synaptic proteins in the brain and the brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) of AD patients, analyze their associations with Aβ, tau, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, and investigate the biological role of SV2A. METHODS: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics of BDEVs and immunohistochemistry staining were conducted on postmortem brain samples from 57 AD patients and 48 nondemented controls. The levels of SV2A, synaptophysin (SYP), and other synaptic proteins in the brain tissues and the BDEVs, and their associations with Aβ, tau (phospho-tau and Braak stages), other proteins and the APOE ε4 allele, were analyzed. RESULTS: SV2A levels were significantly lower in AD patients than in nondemented controls, particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. APOE ε4 carriers presented further reductions in SV2A levels compared with noncarriers. The SV2A levels in BDEVs and brain tissues were positively correlated with SYP levels and negatively correlated with Aβ and phospho-tau levels. Reductions in SV2A were associated with decreased levels of other synaptic proteins, such as synaptotagmins, GAP43, and SNAP25. SV2A emerged as a central hub with interactions with proteins from subnetworks related to synaptic vesicle formation and fusion. CONCLUSION: SV2A levels in brain tissues and BDEVs are reduced in AD patients, particularly in those carrying the APOE ε4 allele, and are correlated with Aβ and tau pathologies.

Using bulk and scRNA-seq over the first weeks of infection, we describe an unexpected, higher early pulmonary type I IFN response in relatively resistant C57BL/6 as compared with highly TB-susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice. C57BL/6 mice showed pronounced early monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) accumulation and extensive CD4+ T cell-MDM interactions in lung lesions, accompanied by high expression of T cell-attractant chemokines by MDMs. Conversely, lesions in C3HeB/FeJ mice were dominated by neutrophils with high expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines, from which CD4+ T cells were spatially segregated. Early type I IFN signaling blockade reduced bacterial load and neutrophil swarming within early TB lesions while increasing CD4+ T cell numbers in both C57BL/6 and C3HeB/FeJ mice, with later more pronounced effects on bacterial load in C3HeB/FeJ mice.

METHODS: Accelerometer-derived MVPA data from UK Biobank participants free of AF at baseline were used to examine associations between distinct MVPA timing patterns (inactive, morning, afternoon, evening, mixed) and incident AF risk, estimated via multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total of 88,024 participants (57.4% female) were followed for a median of 7.87 years, during which 3,815 developed incident AF. In the fully adjusted Cox model, engaging in MVPA in the morning, afternoon, or at mixed times was associated with lower AF risk, compared with inactivity. The morning activity group showed the greatest risk reduction (HR = 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-0.89; p < 0.001). Stratified analyses revealed that adults < 65 years benefited most from morning exercise. For diabetics, morning and afternoon MVPA were protective (HR 0.66, p = 0.001; HR 0.77, p = 0.025). Among non-diabetics, evening activity offered the greatest benefit (HR 0.76, p = 0.029). In non-hypertensive individuals, the timing of activity made little difference. However, among patients with hypertension, engaging in activity at any time of day was associated with a reduced risk of atrial fibrillation, with the greatest benefit observed in the morning (HR = 0.74, p < 0.001).

It remains unknown whether prenatal acetaminophen exposure measured in a biological specimen is associated with birth outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of acetaminophen measured in meconium with birthweight, gestational age, preterm birth, size for gestational age, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and high blood pressure. METHODS: This birth cohort from Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, included 773 live births. Mothers with no thyroid disease enrolled at their first prenatal care visit or delivery. Acetaminophen was measured in meconium for 393 children at delivery. We tested associations of prenatal acetaminophen with birthweight, preterm birth, gestational age, small and large for gestational age, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and high blood pressure. We imputed missing data via multiple imputation and used inverse probability weighting to account for confounding and selection bias. RESULTS: Acetaminophen was detected in 222 meconium samples (56.5%). Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with decreased birthweight by 136 g (β = -136; 95% CI [-229, -43]), 20% increased weekly hazard of delivery (hazard ratio = 1.20; 95% CI [1.00, 1.43]), and over 60% decreased odds of being born large for gestational age (odds ratio = 0.38; 95% CI [0.20, 0.75]).

Here, we demonstrate that NAFLD is correlated with a higher risk of breast cancer in individuals with atypical hyperplasia and poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. In mice, fatty liver exosomes are preferentially accumulated in adipocytes, and their enrichment in mammary adipocytes fosters a pro-tumor breast microenvironment. Adipocyte tropism is dictated by the binding of exosomal ErbB4 to neuregulin 4 (Nrg4). tRNA methyltransferase 10 homolog C (TRMT10C) in fatty liver exosomes translocates to mitochondria and inhibits Nd5 and Nd6 mRNA translation by inducing N(1)-methyladenosine modifications in adipocytes. ND5 and ND6 reduction increases reactive oxygen species and consequently enhances free fatty acid release, which fuels tumor progression. Plasma ErbB4(+) exosomes are an independent prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer and comorbid NAFLD.

The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes(2). Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers(3,4) occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage(5,6). However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",Nature,24/09/2025

Our study reveals that SnRK2 kinases (SnRK2.2 and SnRK2.3) are critical regulators of root gravitropism through their direct phosphorylation of the auxin transporter PIN2 at S259. We demonstrate that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation modulates both the polar localization and transport activity of PIN2. Importantly, SnRK2s function antagonistically to the AGCVIII kinase PID, which phosphorylates PIN2 at a distinct site (S258), establishing a regulatory balance essential for adaptive root growth. Structural modeling and phosphorylation assays further suggest that SnRK2s-mediated phosphorylation at S259 sterically hinders access of PID to S258, providing a mechanistic basis for their antagonistic relationship. These findings uncover a novel regulatory mechanism, by which plants fine-tune root developmental programs to adapt to environmental stimuli, highlighting the evolutionary significance of multilayered kinase-mediated regulation in plant adaptation.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

Based on new developments in IgAN assessment and therapy, a major update of the guideline was necessary in 2024. Compared with the last version, the KDIGO 2025 IgAN guideline now encourages a more liberal kidney biopsy policy and suggests aiming for stricter proteinuria control, with a goal of <0.5 g/d, ideally <0.3 g/d, and a stable estimated glomerular filtration rate. A major new concept in the 2025 guideline is to initiate treatment with (i) therapies that prevent or reduce pathogenic IgA production and IgA/IgA and IgA/IgG immune complex formation along with (ii) therapies to manage the consequences of existing IgAN-induced nephron loss. Approaches to achieve the first aim are currently limited to targeted-release budesonide (Nefecon) or reduced-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy and, in Chinese patients, mycophenolate mofetil. Approaches to the more generic second aim include healthy lifestyle education, renin-angiotensin system blockers, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and/or dual endothelin angiotensin receptor blockers. Little has changed for special situations of IgA-dominant immune complex glomerular diseases such as nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and pregnancy in IgAN, or children with IgAN or IgAV, given the lack of major clinical trials in these patient populations. Here, we provide an executive summary of the most important changes in the KDIGO 2025 IgAN and IgAV guideline as a quick reference.",Kidney international,01/10/2025
10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.4610,Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia in People With Chronic Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Scott AJ, Correa AB, Bisby MA, Chandra SS, Rahimi M, Christina S, Heriseanu AI, Dear BF","IMPORTANCE: Insomnia is highly prevalent among individuals with chronic disease (eg, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) and results in poorer disease outcomes and quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia. However, concerns remain about its applicability and efficacy in people with chronic disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nature, efficacy, and acceptability of CBT-I in adults with chronic disease, and to identify moderators of treatment outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to June 5, 2025. Additional records were identified from reference lists of relevant reviews and studies. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults (aged ≥18 years) with chronic disease and insomnia. Studies using CBT-I with measured sleep outcomes were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two assessors extracted data from RCTs. Hedges g was used to calculate effect sizes, and random effects meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity was assessed via I2. Subgroup analyses examined whether outcomes varied by delivery format, chronic condition type, or control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency. Secondary outcomes included treatment acceptability and adverse effects. RESULTS: Sixty-seven RCTs (5232 participants) met inclusion criteria, including chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and stroke. CBT-I was associated with significantly improved outcomes for insomnia severity (g = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81-1.16) and moderate effect sizes regarding sleep efficiency (g = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63-0.91) and sleep onset latency (g = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.78). Subgroup analyses revealed some sample, treatment, and methodological moderators (eg, longer treatment yielded better outcomes for sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency). Satisfaction with CBT-I was high, with a mean dropout rate of 13.3%. Treatment-related adverse effects were rare. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that CBT-I demonstrated strong efficacy and acceptability in chronic disease populations, with moderate to large effect sizes that appear comparable to those in non-chronic disease populations. Efficacy of CBT-I was similar across a range of disease subgroups. Future research should explore the role and nature of treatment adaptations for specific populations and increase access to CBT-I in medical settings.",JAMA internal medicine,22/09/2025

This study investigated the relationship between serum HDL-C levels and cognitive function, utilizing cross-sectional data and Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014, including 19,931 participants. Among them, 2,777 individuals aged 60 years and older with complete HDL-C levels and cognitive function data were included. Cognitive function was assessed using tests such as the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Immediate and Delayed Recall, the Animal Fluency Test, and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Additionally, MR analysis was employed to assess the causal relationship between genetically predicted HDL-C and dementia. RESULTS: Gender-stratified analyses revealed sex-specific patterns in the relationship between HDL-C and cognitive function. In fully adjusted linear models, men showed consistently positive associations across all cognitive domains, including delayed recall (β = 0.10, 95% CI 0.04-0.17, p < 0.001), immediate recall (β = 0.06, 95% CI 0.00-0.12, p = 0.047), verbal fluency (β = 0.20, 95% CI 0.14-0.26, p < 0.001), processing speed (β = 0.09, 95% CI 0.05-0.14, p < 0.001), and overall composite score (β = 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.62, p < 0.001). In women, these associations were attenuated or non-significant for immediate recall, delayed recall, and composite cognition, suggesting non-linearity. Further concentration-response analyses revealed a linear positive association in men and an inverted U-shaped relationship in women. MR analyses indicated a protective association between genetically predicted HDL-C and Alzheimer's disease risk (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.89, p = 0.019). However, sensitivity analyses revealed attenuation after MR-PRESSO outlier correction (β=-0.013, p = 0.756), and inconsistent estimates across methods, with significant heterogeneity (Q-test p < 0.001) and evidence of pleiotropy. In multivariable analysis, adjusting for LDL-C and TG, IVW (β = 0.290, p = 0.048) and Lasso regression (β = 0.752, p = 0.008) indicated weak positive correlations. However, MR-Egger (β = 0.752, p = 0.008) revealed potential pleiotropic interference (intercept p = 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maintaining optimal serum HDL-C levels may help preserve cognitive function in older adults. Notably, sex-specific associations were observed, warranting further investigation into underlying mechanisms.",BioData mining,22/09/2025

Uncovering associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric genetic liability and AN outcomes can facilitate its personalized treatment. In this study, we investigated the associations between transdiagnostic psychiatric genetic liability and outcomes of AN. Genomic structural equation models were fitted to genome-wide association data for AN and psychiatric disorders with high genetic correlations with AN (obsessive-compulsive symptoms [OCS], major depressive disorder [MDD], schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders) to extract one shared and five trait-specific genetic components. Next, we calculated the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for these components, including PRS(shared), PRS(AN-specific), PRS(OCS-specific), PRS(MDD-specific), PRS(SCZ-specific) and PRS(ANX-specific), which index the shared genetic liability to all five psychiatric traits, and genetic liability specific to AN, OCS, MDD, SCZ and ANX, respectively. We then tested associations between these PRSs and clinical outcomes reported between 1997 and 2018 among AN cases from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI), linked to Swedish National Registers. The clinical outcomes included cumulative disease burden (i.e., number of diagnoses, medication prescriptions, and inpatient days), risks of psychiatric comorbidities, and AN symptomatology. Among 4028 included AN cases, the mean (SD) birth year was 1985 (9), and 3947 (98.0%) were female. Within AN, +1 SD increase of PRS(shared) was associated with 9-39% excess risk of disease burden and psychiatric comorbidity, whereas the associations between PRS(AN-specific) and most clinical outcomes were statistically non-significant. +1 SD increase of PRS(MDD-specific) was associated with 3-29% increased risk of AN disease burden. Our findings show that shared psychiatric liability is associated with more adverse AN outcomes, whereas AN-specific liability is not a good indicator for its clinical course. This study provides a novel perspective on factors influencing heterogeneity in AN clinical course.",Molecular psychiatry,23/09/2025

But there is a lack of population-representative cohort studies evaluating its effects on a range of neuropsychological and behavioural endpoints. We aimed to assess whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is adversely associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1 and 5 years of age. METHODS: This Spanish birth cohort study included 2644 mother-child pairs recruited during pregnancy. The proportion of liveborn participants evaluated at 1 and 5 years was 88.8% and 79.9%, respectively. Use of acetaminophen was evaluated prospectively in two structured interviews. Ever/never use and frequency of use (never, sporadic, persistent) were measured. Main neurodevelopment outcomes were assessed using Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST), Conner's Kiddie Continuous Performance Test (K-CPT) and ADHD-DSM-IV form list. Regression models were adjusted for social determinants and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Over 40% of mothers reported using acetaminophen. Ever-exposed offspring had higher risks of presenting more hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.98), K-CPT commission errors (IRR = 1.10, 1.03-1.17), and lower detectability scores (coefficient β = -0.75, -0.13--0.02). CAST scores were increased in ever-exposed males (β = 0.63, 0.09-1.18). Increased effect sizes of risks by frequency of use were observed for hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (IRR = 2.01, 0.95-4.24) in all children, K-CPT commission errors (IRR = 1.32, 1.05-1.66) and detectability (β = -0.18, -0.36-0.00) in females, and CAST scores in males (β = 1.91, 0.44-3.38). CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with a greater number of autism spectrum symptoms in males and showed adverse effects on attention-related outcomes for both genders. These associations seem to be dependent on the frequency of exposure.",International journal of epidemiology,01/12/2016

Our previous studies demonstrated that nuclear fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 1 (NUFIP1)-mediated ribophagy conferred cytoprotection against apoptosis in CD4(+) T lymphocytes during sepsis, thereby preserving host immunocompetence. Despite growing evidence linking PANoptosis to the pathogenesis of various diseases, the potential role of ribophagy in modulating CD4(+) T lymphocytes' PANoptosis in sepsis remains largely unclear. In the present study, we employed both lipopolysaccharide-stimulated Jurkat T cells and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis models to demonstrate marked exacerbation of CD4(+) T lymphocyte PANoptosis following NUFIP1 knockdown (KD), associated with impaired immune function, as evidenced by diminished cytokine production and T cell proliferation. Tandem mass tagging (TMT) proteomic analysis identified Z-nucleic acid binding protein 1 (ZBP1)-mediated PANoptosome formation and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway as critical nodes in ribophagy-dependent cytoprotection. Mechanistically, sepsis-induced ribosome collision activated the cGAS-STING signaling axis, which in turn recruited NUFIP1 to STING protein complexes. Clinical analysis of septic patients revealed enhanced ribophagy and PANoptosis in peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells, consistent with the experimental findings. These results suggest that NUFIP1-mediated ribophagy alleviates CD4(+) T lymphocyte PANoptosis in sepsis via the cGAS-STING pathway, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting ribophagy and PANoptosis pathways to mitigate immune paralysis and improve the outcomes following septic insults.","Research (Washington, D.C.)",01/01/2025

In skeletal muscle, these benefits are in part transcriptionally coordinated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). The importance of PGC-1α to exercise-induced adaptations in the heart has been unclear. Here we show that deleting PGC-1α specifically in cardiomyocytes prevents the expected benefits from exercise training and instead leads to heart failure after just 6 weeks of training. Consistent with this, in humans, rare genetic variants in PPARGC1A, which encodes PGC-1α, are associated with increased risk of heart failure. In this model, we identify growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) as a key heart-secreted mediator that contributes to this dysfunction. Blocking cardiac Gdf15 expression improves cardiac performance and exercise capacity in these mice. Finally, in human heart tissue, lower cardiomyocyte PPARGC1A expression is associated with higher GDF15 expression and reduced cardiomyocyte density. These findings uncover a crucial role for cardiomyocyte PGC-1α in enabling healthy cardiac adaptation to exercise in part through suppression of GDF15.",Nature cardiovascular research,24/09/2025

We aimed to emulate the PIONEER-2 trial using electronic health records to compare the effectiveness and persistence of oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre study using electronic health records from Italian diabetes clinics. New users of oral semaglutide or empagliflozin were matched 1:2 and followed for up to 18 months. The primary outcome was HbA1c change; secondary outcomes included weight change and treatment persistence. Analyses used mixed models for repeated measures under both treatment policy and trial product estimands. RESULTS: After matching, we included new users of oral semaglutide (n = 105) or empagliflozin (n = 207). Mean age was 65 years, diabetes duration 10 years, baseline HbA1c 7.6%, BMI 29 kg/m(2), and 94% were on metformin. Only 28.6% of new users of oral semaglutide reached the 14 mg dose and 31.4% of empagliflozin new users reached the 25 mg dose. HbA1c reduction was significantly greater with oral semaglutide than with empagliflozin (mean difference - 0.35%, p <0.001). Weight loss over time was similar, with oral semaglutide showing a modest advantage at 18 months among persistent patients. Persistence was lower for semaglutide (HR for discontinuation 1.47, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Under routine care, new users of oral semaglutide achieved better glycaemic control compared with empagliflozin new users, with similar weight loss but lower treatment persistence. These findings support the results of PIONEER-2 and its transferability to clinical practice.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",24/09/2025

However, most patients experience refractoriness to CAR T-cells or relapse after treatment. Many efforts are underway to understand the mechanisms behind CAR T-cell failure, which are mainly related to CAR T-cell dysfunction, tumor-intrinsic resistance, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, manufacturing issues, or patient-related factors. Several strategies are being developed to overcome these resistance mechanisms, including the engineering of more functional allogeneic CAR T-cell products, the targeting of alternative tumor antigens, and combination therapies with other drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors or small molecules to enhance CAR T-cell efficacy.

Finerenone reduced the composite endpoint of heart failure events and cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure with preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFmrEF). This study aimed to investigate the safety and cardiac effects of finerenone in patients with DKD with or without HFpEF/HFmrEF in a real-world setting. METHODS: Patients with DKD were prospectively enrolled and were treated with finerenone according to best clinical practice. Clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic assessments were performed before, 4 weeks and 6 months after starting finerenone. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with DKD were included. At baseline, patients had a typical risk profile with arterial hypertension (90.3%) and hyperlipoproteinemia (87.1%). Most patients were treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (93.5%). Treatment with finerenone was safe and well tolerated: after 4 weeks, the glomerular filtration rate decreased slightly from 52 (43-78) mL/min/1.73 m(2) to 48.0 (39.0-71.0) mL/min/1.73 m(2) (P = 0.002 vs. baseline), but stabilized thereafter. Similarly, the median potassium value increased from 4.2 (3.8-4.5) mmol/L to 4.4 (4.2-4.8) mmol/L (P = 0.017) after 4 weeks, but remained stable thereafter [4.4 (4.1-4.6) mmol/L (P = 0.079)]. Only one patient (3.2%) had an unplanned hospitalization and concomitant hyperkalaemia up to 6.0 mmol/L. HFpEF/HFmrEF was frequently found in patients with DKD (71.0%), although most patients had a rather early stage with only mild symptoms and a median N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) value of 150.8 (54.5-325.7) ng/L. During treatment with finerenone, NT-proBNP and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) remained stable. In contrast, left atrial volume index (LAVI) decreased from baseline [31.2 (26.8-39.7) mL/m(2)] to 4 weeks follow-up [29.7 (20.8-33.6) mL/m(2), P = 0.027] and decreased further after 6 months [26.6 (20.8-34.9) mL/m(2), P = 0.029]. In the subgroup of patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF, E/e' decreased from 11.9 (8.7-14.5) at baseline to 9.9 (8.0-12.4) after 6 months (P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: In a real-world setting, treatment with finerenone is safe and well-tolerated in patients with DKD and may improve functional and structural cardiac parameters.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prospective associations between cord plasma acetaminophen metabolites and physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, both ADHD and ASD, and developmental disabilities (DDs) in childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort study analyzed 996 mother-infant dyads, a subset of the Boston Birth Cohort, who were enrolled at birth and followed up prospectively at the Boston Medical Center from October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2018. EXPOSURES: Three cord acetaminophen metabolites (unchanged acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and 3-[N-acetyl-l-cystein-S-yl]-acetaminophen) were measured in archived cord plasma samples collected at birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, and other DDs as documented in the child's medical records. RESULTS: Of 996 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.9] years; 548 [55.0%] male), the final sample included 257 children (25.8%) with ADHD only, 66 (6.6%) with ASD only, 42 (4.2%) with both ADHD and ASD, 304 (30.5%) with other DDs, and 327 (32.8%) who were neurotypical. Unchanged acetaminophen levels were detectable in all cord plasma samples. Compared with being in the first tertile, being in the second and third tertiles of cord acetaminophen burden was associated with higher odds of ADHD diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] for second tertile, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.40-3.69; OR for third tertile, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.67) and ASD diagnosis (OR for second tertile, 2.14; 95% CI, 0.93-5.13; OR for third tertile, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.62-8.60). Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses found consistent associations between acetaminophen buden and ADHD and acetaminophen burden and ASD across strata of potential confounders, including maternal indication, substance use, preterm birth, and child age and sex, for which point estimates for the ORs vary from 2.3 to 3.5 for ADHD and 1.6 to 4.1 for ASD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cord biomarkers of fetal exposure to acetaminophen were associated with significantly increased risk of childhood ADHD and ASD in a dose-response fashion. Our findings support previous studies regarding the association between prenatal and perinatal acetaminophen exposure and childhood neurodevelopmental risk and warrant additional investigations.",JAMA psychiatry,01/02/2020
10.1038/s41594-025-01659-6,A small molecule stabilizer rescues the surface expression of nearly all missense variants in a GPCR.,"Mighell TL, Lehner B","Reduced protein abundance is the most frequent mechanism by which rare missense variants cause disease. A promising therapeutic avenue for treating reduced abundance variants is pharmacological chaperones (PCs, also known as correctors or stabilizers), small molecules that bind to and stabilize target proteins. PCs have been approved as clinical treatments for specific variants, but protein energetics suggest their effects might be much more general. To comprehensively assess PC efficacy for variation in a given protein, it is necessary to first assign the molecular mechanism explaining all pathogenic variants, then measure the response to the PC. Here we establish such a framework for the vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R), a G-protein-coupled receptor in which loss-of-function variants cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Our data show that more than half of NDI variants are poorly expressed, highlighting loss of stability as the major pathogenic mechanism. Treatment with a PC rescues the expression of 87% of destabilized variants. The non-rescued variants identify the drug's predicted binding site. Our results provide proof-of-principle that small molecule binding can rescue destabilizing variants throughout a protein's structure. The application of this principle to other proteins should allow the development of effective therapies for many different rare diseases.",Nature structural & molecular biology,22/09/2025

The central repeat region of CSP is the primary immunological target of the sporozoite stage, yet little is known about its structure or function. Here, we show that sporozoite mutants with truncated or scrambled CSP repeats exhibit impaired motility due to altered adhesion site formation and dynamics. Since CSP forms the environment in which the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP)-containing adhesion sites assemble, our data suggest that the dense CSP coat is altered in the repeat mutants, affecting adhesion site formation. We hypothesized that this role depends on the biophysical properties of the repeats, and used single-molecule fluorescence-force spectroscopy to test this hypothesis.

Dysbiosis contributes to neuroinflammation, amyloid-β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, blood-brain barrier disruption, and cognitive decline. Synbiotics (combinations of probiotics and prebiotics) offer a promising strategy to modulate GM, potentially ameliorating these AD hallmarks through multiple mechanisms including enhanced production of neuroprotective short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), reduced inflammation, improved gut barrier integrity, and immunomodulation. OBJECTIVE: This review critically evaluates the current evidence on the therapeutic potential of synbiotics for AD. It aims to synthesize findings from preclinical and clinical studies regarding the efficacy of synbiotics in improving cognitive function and AD pathology, elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms including GM modulation, SCFA production, immune regulation, and gut-brain signaling, and identify key challenges and future research directions for translating GM-targeted interventions into effective AD therapies. CONCLUSION: Synbiotics demonstrate significant potential, particularly in early AD, by improving cognitive domains, reducing neuroinflammation and AD biomarkers, and modulating beneficial microbial metabolites. However, challenges include confounding factors, unresolved questions about causality, inconsistent results in advanced disease, and insufficient large-scale human trials. Future success hinges on rigorous longitudinal randomized controlled trials integrating multi-omics approaches, advanced in vitro models, and personalized strategies considering baseline microbiota and host genetics. While not a standalone cure, synbiotics represent a valuable component within multi-target therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating the gut-brain axis to slow AD progression.",Journal of translational medicine,24/09/2025

However, little is known about the molecular features of VI. To investigate, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis of 95 human PDAC tissue samples from eight treatment-naïve patients. Our analysis revealed that, compared with PDAC in stroma, PDAC with VI demonstrated up-regulation of genes associated with epithelial differentiation, classical subtype, and benign exocrine function. Conversely, PDAC with VI demonstrated down-regulation of genes associated with mesenchymal differentiation, basal-like subtype, and disease aggression. Additionally, we uncovered characteristics of VI morphology that correlated with these molecular features. VI-intraepithelial neoplasia-like foci had preserved venous architecture and had a classical, epithelial molecular phenotype, whereas VI-destructive foci had destroyed venous architecture and had a more basal-like, mesenchymal phenotype. We contextualized our findings using public RNA-seq data and observed that metastatic PDAC had greater similarity to PDAC in stroma than to PDAC with VI, whereas circulating tumor cells showed no preferential association. We confirmed our findings by spatial proteomic analysis of VI in an independent cohort of 19 treatment-naïve patients with PDAC. Overall, our work provides a reference atlas of spatial transcriptomics and proteomics of VI in PDAC and reveals unexpected increases in molecular features associated with better patient outcomes.",Science translational medicine,24/09/2025
10.1093/nar/gkaf939,ATRX cooperates with TOP2B for replication fork stability and DNA damage response through G-quadruplex regulation.,"Pang Y, Cheng M, Wang J, Wang R, Chen X, Zhang C, Yang Y, Ji T, Liu M, Zhang J, Zhong C","G-quadruplexes (G4s) are noncanonical DNA structures that promote genomic instability, particularly in α-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked (ATRX)-deficient gliomas. Although TOP2B has been implicated in chromatin remodeling, its role in G4 resolution remains poorly understood. Here, we identify TOP2B as a previously unrecognized regulator of G4 homeostasis and show that it functionally cooperates with ATRX to facilitate G4 resolution during DNA replication. Disruption of this pathway by CX-5461, a small molecule originally developed as an RNA polymerase I inhibitor, leads to G4 accumulation, replication stress, and DNA damage. Mechanistically, CX-5461 acts as a TOP2B poison that selectively impairs TOP2B binding at G4 sites, alters replication fork dynamics, and induces MRE11-dependent degradation of stalled forks. These effects are strongly enhanced in ATRX-deficient glioma cells, where TOP2B plays a dominant role in G4 regulation. While etoposide similarly induces G4-related DNA damage, it does not affect the ATRX-TOP2B interaction, highlighting CX-5461's unique mechanism. Our findings establish TOP2B as a critical player in G4 resolution, reveal CX-5461's dual function as a TOP2B poison and G4 stabilizer, and propose G4-associated replication stress as a potential therapeutic target in ATRX-deficient gliomas.",Nucleic acids research,23/09/2025

However, it remains an undruggable target. Here, we studied the antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of combining E7386 (an oral protein-protein interaction inhibitor targeting CREB-binding protein (CBP)/β-catenin) with lenvatinib and elucidated a novel mechanism of action of E7386 that boosts antitumor response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a genetically engineered CTNNB1-mutant murine HCC model and randomized the animals to receive vehicle, E7386, lenvatinib, or the combination (n=22-23/arm). We evaluated survival and analyzed the tumors transcriptomically and by immunohistochemistry. Also, we analyzed five patient-derived organoids (PDOs), four HCC cell lines, and seven paired pre-/on- treatment specimens from HCC patients receiving E7386 in combination with lenvatinib in the context of a phase 1b/2 trial (NCT04008797). RESULTS: E7386 in combination with lenvatinib significantly prolonged mouse survival versus monotherapy. Cell lines and PDO data corroborated that sensitivity to E7386 involves processes beyond CBP/β-catenin interaction blockade. Mechanistically, E7386 promoted Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) activation, triggering integrated stress response in preclinical models of HCC. In vivo, E7386 concomitantly potentiated the antiangiogenic effects of lenvatinib, resulting in increased antitumor efficacy. Upregulation of ATF4 gene expression signatures was confirmed in four out of seven E7386+lenvatinib-treated HCC patients, three of which exhibited tumor diameter shrinkage >30%. CONCLUSIONS: E7386 sensitized tumors to lenvatinib, thereby enhancing survival in mice compared with either monotherapy. In patients, E7386 combined with lenvatinib promoted tumor shrinkage and, in parallel, activated ATF4 signaling.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,23/09/2025
10.1167/jov.24.3.6,Corrective mechanisms of motion extrapolation.,"Wang X, Song Y, Liao M, Liu T, Liu L, Reynaud A","Transmission and processing of sensory information in the visual system takes time. For motion perception, our brain can overcome this intrinsic neural delay through extrapolation mechanisms and accurately predict the current position of a continuously moving object. But how does the system behave when the motion abruptly changes and the prediction becomes wrong? Here we address this question by studying the perceived position of a moving object with various abrupt motion changes by human observers. We developed a task in which a bar is monotonously moving horizontally, and then motion suddenly stops, reverses, or disappears-then-reverses around two vertical stationary reference lines. Our results showed that participants overestimated the position of the stopping bar but did not perceive an overshoot in the motion reversal condition. When a temporal gap was added at the reverse point, the perceptual overshoot of the end point scaled with the gap durations. Our model suggests that the overestimation of the object position when it disappears is not linear as a function of its speeds but gradually fades out. These results can thus be reconciled in a single process where there is an interplay of the cortical motion prediction mechanisms and the late sensory transient visual inputs.",Journal of vision,01/03/2024

We apply the discriminative dimensionality reduction with trees (DDRTree) algorithm to seven clinical variables in 10,091 adults with newly diagnosed T2D from a nationally representative Chinese cohort. Distinct mortality patterns are observed across phenotypes. Cardiovascular mortality is highest in the most hypertensive and obese individuals, while diabetic ketoacidosis/coma mortality is largely driven by the combination of hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Additionally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality is higher in those with elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol levels. These patterns are similar in UK Biobank, though cardiovascular mortality is highest in those with dyslipidemia and obesity. Predictive models incorporating these variables show good performance and an online tool is provided for individual risk prediction.

It can bind to DNA on its own as well as in complex with other proteins such as CENP-TW and FANCM to recognize specific substrates. CENP-SX binds nonspecifically to dsDNA, similar to other histone-fold proteins. Several low-resolution structures of CENP-SX in complex with DNA are known, but a high-resolution structure is still lacking. The DNA-binding properties of CENP-SX and FANCM-CENP-SX complexes with various lengths of dsDNA were compared and the band-shift patterns and migration positions were found to differ. To confirm the DNA-binding properties in detail, CENP-SX-DNA and FANCM-CENP-SX-DNA complexes were crystallized. Analysis of the crystals revealed that they all contained the CENP-SX-DNA complex, irrespective of the complex that was used in crystallization. Detailed diffraction data analyses revealed that there were two types of crystal with different space groups, P2(1) and C2, where the volume of the P2(1) asymmetric unit is twice as large as that of the C2 asymmetric unit. Analysis of the self-rotation function revealed the presence of twofold and fourfold symmetry in both crystals. This suggests that there may be multiple molecules of CENP-SX and DNA within the asymmetric unit with respective symmetry. Structure determination of the present crystals should reveal details of the DNA-binding properties of CENP-SX.","Acta crystallographica. Section F, Structural biology communications",01/05/2022

However, the harsh gastrointestinal environment, the low permeability of the intestinal epithelium, and hepatic clearance of foreign particles remain key challenges in this area. Here, we report the site-specific adaptive milk-derived nanovesicles (MiNVs) capable of overcoming intestinal and hepatic barriers for oral insulin delivery. These MiNVs could bind natural IgG on their surface, enabling FcRn-mediated transcytosis by evading the lysosomal degradation pathway. Upon reaching the liver, MiNVs responded to the elevated levels of biothiols in the hepatic microenvironment, triggering site-specific insulin release. In type 1 diabetic rats, the oral bioavailability reached 20.4%, which is about 20-fold higher than that of free insulin. Notably, MiNVs showed effective glycemic control over long-term treatment in type 1 diabetic rat and minipig models.

We engineered chimeric immunomodulatory fusion proteins (IFPs) that convert immunosuppressive TGF-β signals into proliferative/survival Interleukin 2 (IL-2) signals in T cells. Chimeric TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs were constructed by fusing extracellular domains of the TGF-β receptor chains with intracellular domains of IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ to enable TGF-β binding to trigger STAT5 phosphorylation and activate the downstream IL-2 pathway. In human primary CD8(+) T cells, select IFP designs robustly induced p-STAT5 upon exposure to TGF-β1, and simultaneously reduced canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. IFP-expressing T cells proliferated and displayed enhanced viability in response to TGF-β1, effectively leveraging TGF-β-rich conditions to outcompete nontransduced cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that IFP signaling promoted T cell activation and allowed maintenance of stemness during culture with TGF-β. Functionally, coexpressing IFPs with a mesothelin-specific T cell receptor improved tumor killing and promoted T cell expansion in the presence of TGF-β1, highlighting both neutralization of TGF-β-mediated suppression and enhanced proliferation. TGF-βR/IL-2R IFPs appear promising for reprogramming the signals T cells receive in the TME and improving efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in solid tumors.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

Due to its heterogeneous nature, HFpEF presents substantial challenges in diagnosis and management. Given the limited treatment options and lifestyle-associated comorbidities, early identification is crucial for establishing effective preventive strategies. Here, we introduce and validate a machine learning-based multi-omics approach that integrates clinical and molecular data to detect and characterize HFpEF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A supervised classifier was trained on a stratified subset of UK Biobank participants (n = 401 917) to identify phenotypic profiles associated with subsequent symptom-defined HFpEF during longitudinal follow-up. Model performance was validated in a non-overlapping hold-out subset from all 22 UK Biobank assessment centres (n = 100 446; 6726 HFpEF cases; 7394 with multi-omics data). The classifier demonstrated robust discriminatory performance, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) of 0.931 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.930-0.931), a sensitivity of 0.857 (95% CI 0.855-0.860) and a specificity of 0.847 (95% CI 0.846-0.847). It identified individuals who subsequently developed HFpEF an average of 6.3 ± 3.9 years before symptom onset in asymptomatic individuals. Similarity network fusion (SNF) identified distinct subgroups, including a high-risk cluster characterized by elevated mortality and dysregulated inflammatory pathways, which was distinguishable with high accuracy (ROC AUC 0.988; 95% CI 0.985-0.990). CONCLUSIONS: We identified HFpEF phenotypes at an early stage, often several years before the onset of clinical symptoms, when the disease trajectory may still be amenable to modification.

OBJECTIVE: To examine hospital staffing and patient outcomes in emergency departments (EDs) and intensive care units (ICUs) before and after hospitals were acquired by private equity. DESIGN: Matched difference-in-differences analysis. SETTING: 100% Medicare Part A and B claims and Cost Report data from 2009 to 2019. PATIENTS: 1 007 529 ED visits and 121 080 ICU hospitalizations across 49 private equity hospitals were compared with 6 179 854 ED visits and 760 377 ICU hospitalizations across 293 matched control hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: Hospital ED and ICU salary expenditures, patient mortality, length of stay, and transfers. Secondary outcomes included hospital-wide salary expenditures and full-time employees. RESULTS: After acquisition, private equity hospitals reduced ED salary expenditures by 18.2% (-$12.63 per inpatient bed day; 95% CI, -$22.74 to -$2.52; P = 0.015) and ICU salary expenditures by 15.9% (-$8.46 per inpatient bed day, CI, -$13.21 to -$3.72; P < 0.001) relative to control. This occurred alongside average hospital-wide reductions in full-time employees by 11.6% and salary expenditures by 16.6%, relative to control. Beneficiaries in EDs of private equity hospitals experienced 7.0 additional deaths per 10 000 visits after acquisition relative to control (13.4% increase from a raw baseline of 52.4 deaths per 10 000; P = 0.009). No differential change in ICU mortality was observed. However, patients in private equity EDs and ICUs experienced a 4.2% and 10.6% increase in transfers, respectively, to other acute care hospitals after acquisition relative to control. On average, ICU length of stay shortened by 0.2 days. Sensitivity analyses produced qualitatively similar findings. LIMITATION: Potential unmeasured confounding; lack of generalizability to other acquisitions or patient populations. CONCLUSION: After private equity acquisition, hospitals on average reduced salaries and staffing relative to nonacquired hospitals, notably in the EDs and ICUs, which are higher-acuity and staffing-sensitive areas. This decreased capacity to deliver care may explain the increased patient transfers to other hospitals, shortened ICU lengths of stay, and increased ED mortality.

Although it is classified as a neuromuscular disease, DM1 is a multisystem disorder that affects nearly all organ systems, particularly skeletal and smooth muscles, the central nervous system and the heart. Its phenotypic variability extends beyond a continuum of severity, encompassing differences in age of onset and organ involvement. DM1 is caused by a trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion within the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene, leading to a toxic RNA gain-of-function mechanism that disrupts RNA splicing, causing widespread cellular dysfunction. Despite progress in understanding DM1 pathogenesis, gaps remain in elucidating genotype-phenotype correlations, genetic modifiers and mechanisms that influence disease progression. Breakthroughs in the past five to ten years have uncovered important insights into the molecular underpinnings of DM1 and accelerated therapeutic innovation. Targeted interventions such as small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides and gene-editing technologies are progressing into clinical trials. Additionally, emerging research on somatic instability, epigenetic modifications and novel biomarkers suggests approaches for precision medicine.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared with placebo in youth-onset type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (39 sites), multinational (eight countries) trial over 30 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for 22 weeks in which all participants received tirzepatide. Participants aged 10 to <18 years with youth-onset type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and/or basal insulin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, or placebo administered by subcutaneous injection with a single-dose pen. Randomisation was stratified by age group (≤14 years or >14 years) and antihyperglycaemic medication use (metformin, basal insulin, or both). All participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment during the 30-week double-blind period. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to week 30. Data from all participants who received at least one dose of study drug were used to analyse efficacy and safety. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05260021). FINDINGS: Between April 12, 2022, and Dec 27, 2023, 146 participants were screened, of whom 99 (60 [61%] female, 39 [39%] male; mean age 14·7 years [SD 1·8]; mean baseline HbA(1c) 8·04% [1·23]) were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 5 mg (n=32), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=33), or placebo (n=34). At week 30, tirzepatide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA(1c), with a mean reduction of 2·23% in the pooled tirzepatide group versus an increase of 0·05% in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference -2·28%; 95% CI -2·87 to -1·69; p<0·0001). Glycaemic efficacy was sustained up to 52 weeks with tirzepatide treatment. Tirzepatide also resulted in significant reductions in BMI of 7·4% and 11·2% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 0·4% in the placebo group at 30 weeks. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide treatment were gastrointestinal, all mild to moderate in severity, and decreased over time. Two (6%) patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg group discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent with that reported in adults. No deaths were reported during the study period. INTERPRETATION: Tirzepatide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic control and BMI compared with placebo.

Herein, using combined transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, we identify homeobox A1 (HOXA1) as a functional partner of paired like homeodomain 2 (PITX2) within biomolecular condensates forming via liquid-liquid phase separation. Mechanistically, HOXA1-PITX2 complex facilitates the expression of mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1) and RAS-related protein Rab-3A (RAB3A), which drive lysosomal exocytosis of galectin-1 (LGALS1) and insulin like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) from senescent gastric cancer cells. This process potentiates AKT activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, accelerating tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of gastric cancer. Molecular docking and affinity purification assays reveal nortriptyline (Nor) as a potent phase separation disruptor of HOXA1-PITX2 complex. Preclinical studies demonstrate that Nor administration attenuates lysosomal exocytosis-mediated senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and reduces aggressive phenotypes in gastric cancer models, underscoring the HOXA1/PITX2 axis as a critical regulator of gastric cancer progression. Clinically, elevated expression of HOXA1, PITX2, MCOLN1, RAB3A, LGALS1, and IGFBP7 constitutes a prognostic signature correlating with poor outcomes of gastric cancer patients. Collectively, these results indicate that Nor impedes gastric cancer progression by suppressing HOXA1-PITX2 phase separation and subsequent lysosomal exocytosis-mediated SASP.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",25/09/2025

Whereas antibody features linked to severe DENV disease are well studied, factors influencing infection susceptibility remain less clear. Here, we examined immunoglobulin G (IgG) characteristics before and after DENV vaccination (Dengvaxia) in individuals with a history of prior DENV exposure, comparing those who developed postvaccination infections to those who remained infection free. Elevated anti-DENV afucosylation, present before or after vaccination, was associated with increased likelihood of infection after vaccination. These data were further supported by mechanistic studies, which revealed that nonneutralizing, afucosylated, post-Dengvaxia IgG enhanced DENV replication in mice. This enhancement was dependent on CD16, the receptor for the afucosylated IgG Fc domain. Together, these findings support a model in which the presence of afucosylated IgG promotes virus replication, increasing the likelihood of productive infection upon DENV exposure. Moreover, these results highlight that IgG1 fucosylation is a predictor of risk for breakthrough DENV infection despite vaccination and support the importance of investigating strategies to regulate Fc fucosylation during vaccination.",Science translational medicine,24/09/2025

Despite increasing emphasis on sex and gender influences in CVD, there is limited and conflicting evidence on sex differences in the burden and risk factors of CVD worldwide. We aimed to assess sex differences in the global burden of CVD and its attributable risk factors from 1990 to 2021.

In contrast, females had higher incidence (55.9 [33.9 to 79.6] per 100 000) and prevalence rates (699.5 [415.5 to 983.5] per 100 000) compared to males in lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. A stable difference between females and males was observed in age-standardized DALY rates for overall CVD between 1990 and 2021. High systolic blood pressure, dietary risks, and air pollution were major contributors to CVD-related DALYs for both sexes, although tobacco use (144.0 million DALYs for males vs. 31.5 million for females), elevated LDL cholesterol (130.1 million DALYs for males vs. 75.9 million for females), and impaired kidney function (59.8 million DALYs for males vs. 39.3 million for females) were disproportionately higher in males. CONCLUSION: The global burden of CVD is substantially higher in males compared with females, particularly for ischemic heart disease. While primary risk factors are shared, males show a greater burden from tobacco use and elevated LDL cholesterol.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",24/09/2025
10.1186/s12933-025-02864-9,Treatment and associated outcomes of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with a cardiovascular comorbidity and comparison with guideline recommendations: a German claims data analysis.,"Aberle J, Duerschmied D, Grond M, Lehrke M, Martin S, Tröbs SO, Schultze M, Kossack N, Richter LM, Gabler M","BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are at high risk for micro- and macrovascular complications, and cardiovascular (CV) events are a major cause of their increased risk of early death. Despite well-established treatment guidelines for the management of CV disease in T2DM, little is known about the real-world implementation of these guidelines. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the real-life treatment patterns of T2DM patients with an incident CV comorbidity in Germany, to establish whether treatment is in line with respective national guidelines, and to assess guideline adherence with respect to the occurrence of serious clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using claims data from the WIG2 benchmark database including more than 4.5 million insured individuals. T2DM-prevalent patients with an incident CV comorbidity (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction [MI], heart failure, or coronary artery disease) were identified between 2016 and 2018. Data on patient demographics and comorbidities were collected at baseline. During follow-up, data on treatment patterns and medical outcomes (all-cause mortality, modified 3P-MACE [composite endpoint of all-cause death or inpatient diagnosis of MI or stroke]) were captured. Guideline adherence was assessed using the medication possession ratio and was categorized as completely, partly or non-adherent. RESULTS: Overall, 17,175 T2DM patients with a mean age of 71.1 years experiencing an incident CV comorbidity during the study period were identified. The most frequently prescribed CV treatments during follow-up were renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (83.9%), diuretics (72.6%) and beta-blocking agents (71.8%). Around 40% of the study population were treated completely adherent to the respective CV guidelines. These patients had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to patients not treated in line with the guidelines (90.8% vs. 82.6% survival within 12 months follow-up). Patients not treated according to CV guidelines had a higher mortality and 3P-MACE risk vs. patients completely adherent to guidelines (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.65-2.25 and HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.31-1.69, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results from this claims database study provide important insights into real-world management of CV comorbidities in T2DM patients in Germany and underline that inconsistent guideline adherence is a major unmet challenge to healthcare providers.",Cardiovascular diabetology,23/09/2025

Lipid droplet (LD) dynamics involve several processes, such as synthesis, lipolysis, and lipophagy. They also interact with organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and Golgi apparatus. These dynamic behaviors are essential for the maintenance of cellular energy homeostasis. Under physiological conditions, LDs in pancreatic β-cells are involved in lipid metabolism that regulates insulin secretion, while also isolating harmful lipids to protect β-cells from damage due to nutrient excess. In the adipose tissue, LDs respond to nutrient fluctuations by modulating lipolysis and releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol. Glycerol can enter the liver for gluconeogenesis and changes in FFA levels affect systemic insulin sensitivity, thereby influencing glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and contributing to whole-body glucose homeostasis. Under pathological conditions, abnormal LD accumulation can lead to ectopic lipid deposition and lipotoxicity, exacerbating T2DM and its complications in target organs, such as the heart, kidneys, retina, and brain. Lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, influence LD homeostasis in tissues affected by T2DM. Pharmacological agents, including certain antidiabetic and lipid-lowering drugs as well as bioactive natural products, have demonstrated tissue-specific regulatory effects on LD dynamics. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting LDs, such as photodynamic therapy, gene editing, and gut microbiota modulation, are also being investigated. In summary, a deeper understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of LDs in different organs may offer targeted and integrated treatment options for T2DM and its associated complications.",Lipids in health and disease,23/09/2025

METHODS: Sixty-three female patients with breast cancer who were scheduled for surgery were randomly divided into three groups using the closed envelope method. Participants in Group 1 (G1) received preoperative patient education, exercised under the supervision of a physiotherapist during postoperative hospitalization, received a patient information brochure, and were followed up for 3 months after surgery with telephone calls at 2-week intervals. Participants in Group 2 (G2) received preoperative patient information and a patient information brochure. Participants in Group 3 (G3) received only preoperative patient information. Upper extremity circumference measurements, tissue dielectric constant measurements, shoulder Function, quality of life, and fatigue level assessments were repeated preoperatively, at postoperative discharge, and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS: The limb volumes of all the groups increased over time (p < 0.05; except the volume of the unaffected limb in G2). The volume difference between the extremities increased over time only in G2 (p < 0.05). The subdermal fluid ratios of all the groups increased after surgery but decreased after 3 months. The modified Constant-Murley score, which reflects shoulder Function, decreased in all groups after surgery and was similar to the baseline value after 3 months, except G3, in which the score was significantly lower than the baseline value (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that the physical and psychosocial functions of individuals deteriorate after breast cancer surgery, but early physiotherapist follow-up is effective in maintaining these functions and preventing breast cancer-related lymphedema.

The estrogen receptor (ER) pathway remains a key target in metastatic breast cancer whatever the genomic context. This study assess the activity of the combination of PARP, ER, and PDL1 inhibition among patients with metastatic breast cancer and relevant genomic alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter single arm phase II clinical trial, we used a Simon's two-stage design to evaluate the activity and safety of a combination of durvalumab, olaparib and fulvestrant as second- or third-line in patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer. Patients with either somatic or germline mutations of an HRR-gene, an MSI status or an endocrine resistance-related mutation were eligible. Primary endpoint was 24-week progression-free survival rate (PFSR). RESULTS: The 172 (100%) patients included received prior endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer, 86% a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and 67 (39%) had a previously documented gBRCA1/2m. The 24-week PFSR was 66.7% (95% CI: 58.6-74.1) in the evaluable population and 76.3% (95% CI: 63.4-86.4) in gBRCA1/2m patients. Median PFS was 9.3 months (95% CI: 7.5-12.7) and 12.6 months (95% CI: 8.2-16.7) in the ITT and gBRCA1/2m populations, respectively. Median OS was 30 months (95% CI: 26.6-NR). Most common adverse events of any grade were nausea (59%) and asthenia (43%). No new toxicity warning was detected. CONCLUSION: In patients with ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and selected genomic alterations, this triplet combination was active and had an acceptable toxicity profile (NCT04053322).",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,23/09/2025

Via multiple in vivo screens, we identified RNF19A as an immune suppressor. RNF19A suppresses ICB efficacy by ubiquitinating cGAS to inhibit the release of type I interferon. Surprisingly, UBE2L6, originally identified as a critical interferon-induced ISG15-conjugating E2 enzyme for ISGylation, functions as the major ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzyme to enable RNF19A-driven cGAS ubiquitination. Further, RSK1 phosphorylates UBE2L6 to switch its substrate from ISG15 to ubiquitin, thus converting it from an immune response enhancer to a suppressor. In xenograft models, targeting RSK1 or blocking UBE2L6 phosphorylation improves immune response. In patient tissues, the levels of UBE2L6 and its phosphorylation correlate with poor immune infiltration, limited immune and radiation therapy response, and prognosis. Taken together, we demonstrate that RSK1-mediated UBE2L6 phosphorylation and UBE2L6-RNF19A-driven cGAS ubiquitination lead to tumor-intrinsic immune suppression.",Cell reports,22/09/2025

While AAV9-delivered SMN1 gene therapy (e.g., Zolgensma) improves survival, long-term motor outcomes remain variable. This study integrates bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define immune dysregulation in SMA. We analyzed peripheral blood from infants with SMA (n = 7 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 4 for scRNA-seq, <25 mo of age) along with age-matched healthy controls (n = 4 for bulk RNA-seq; n = 6 for scRNA-seq). We profiled differentially expressed genes, immune pathways, cell-cell interactions, and gene regulatory networks. SMA samples showed distinct transcriptomic signatures and elevated immune activation compared to controls. NECTIN1 was identified as a transcriptomic biomarker of disease progression, while HSPA7 was validated from prior reports. A 6- to 7-mo inflection point marked a transition from metabolic regulation to immune activation in SMA infants. NF-κB-related inflammatory gene expression was significantly elevated post-gene therapy relative to both pretreatment and healthy controls, with IL1B and RNF19B emerging as key transcriptomic mediators. scRNA-seq revealed early dysfunction and G1-phase arrest in CD4+ T-cells, along with a switch to RELB-mediated noncanonical NF-κB signaling. In symptomatic infants, CD8+ T-cells showed higher proliferation and exhaustion, with co-upregulation of TBX21 and EOMES, genes consistent with chronic stimulation and a trajectory toward terminal differentiation. Immune dysregulation is a central feature of SMA and may influence treatment response. These findings support future development of adjunct immunomodulatory strategies to enhance gene therapy efficacy and suggest that immune signatures may correlate with motor function outcomes.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

EVs derived from engineered tumor-targeting killer cells, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. However, the application of CAR-T-EVs is limited by several drawbacks. This study shows that engineered EVs with potent cancer-targeting and killing abilities can be generated from easily manipulable non-killer cells, providing a solution to overcome the limitations of CAR-T-EVs. It is found that EVs derived from non-killer cells such as CD19-targeting 293 cells possess target cell killing capacities comparable to those derived from CD19-CAR-T cells. A technique is developed to ensure the presence of sufficient targeting modules on the EV surface using a chimeric CD8-CD63/CD81 transmembrane region. Uptake of CD19-targeting EVs by target cells can be optimized by switching the route of CD19 endocytosis from clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to aggregation-dependent endocytosis (ADE), leading to lysosomal degradation of the CD19/EVs complex. Degradation of the EVs leads to impairment in the IFN response and subsequent enhancement in EV uptake by target cells, creating a potent feedback cycle. CD19 depletion results in the disruption of the CD19-AKT-Myc pathway in the target cells, enhancing the killing capacity both in vitro and in vivo.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",23/09/2025

As proof of concept for a novel, cross-validated WGS-based method of telomere content (TC) determination combined with mutations, transcriptomics, and functional assays, we studied TC in correlation with specific molecular features of a large cohort (n=1804) of MN patients including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome. When compared to healthy subjects and patients with non-clonal diseases such as persistent polyclonal B cell lymphocytosis, both MN and non-malignant controls with clonal disease, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and aplastic anemia, exhibited decreased TC. Furthermore, we show that TC is lowered in adult MN abrogating correlation with age with considerable TC diversification among certain morphologic and molecular subtypes. For instance, AML harbored the lowest TC. Furthermore, MN originating from a more mature cell of origin (e.g., APL), and those characterized by hyperproliferative driver mutations (e.g., RAS pathway genes) had lower TC, possibly indicating a loss of telomere maintenance capacity. In contrast, MN subtypes arising in a context of profound genetic alterations, such as TP53 mutations and complex karyotype, exhibited a relatively higher/preserved TC compared to other mutations. This phenomenon did not involve alternative lengthening processes but was rather consistent with an increased TC due to preserved activity of the telomerase complex.

Adaptive trial designs, allowing faster evaluation of treatment modalities, remain underexplored in this stage of the disease. We aimed to identify the minimum effective dose of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in people aged 5-25 years with recent-onset, clinical type 1 diabetes. METHODS: MELD-ATG was a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-arm, adaptive dose-ranging, parallel-cohort trial done in 14 accredited trial centres in eight countries (the UK, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, and Slovenia). Participants aged 5-25 years, diagnosed with clinical, stage 3 type 1 diabetes 3-9 weeks before treatment, with random C-peptide concentrations 0·2 nmol/L or more and at least one diabetes-related autoantibody (GADA, IA-2A, or ZnT8) were randomly assigned by a web-based randomisation system into seven consecutive cohorts receiving placebo, 2·5 mg/kg ATG, 1·5 mg/kg ATG, 0·5 mg/kg ATG, or 0·1 mg/kg ATG. Participants in cohort 1 were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1:1, participants in cohorts 2 and 3 were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1, and participants in cohorts 4-7 were randomly assigned 1:1:1. All cohorts included one placebo group and one 2·5 mg/kg ATG group. The other groups were assigned to ATG doses that were determined based on accruing data and the decision of the dose determining committee. The trial cohorts were stratified by age group (5-9 years, 10-17 years, and 18-25 years) with block sizes varying by cohort. Concealment lists, outlining the treatment allocation, were only available for the pharmacists; participants and study teams were masked to treatment allocation. ATG was administered by an intravenous infusion over 2 consecutive days. The primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the stimulated C-peptide concentration during a 2-h mixed-meal tolerance test at 12 months measured as ln(AUC C-peptide + 1). Conditional on finding a statistically significant difference at p<0·05 for 2·5 mg/kg ATG versus placebo, the minimum effective dose of ATG was determined. All randomly assigned participants were included in the primary analysis. All participants who received the study drug were included in the safety analysis. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04509791) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 24, 2020, and Dec 13, 2023, 152 people were recruited and screened, 117 of whom were randomly assigned (placebo n=31, 0·1 mg/kg ATG n=6, 0·5 mg/kg ATG n=35, 1·5 mg/kg ATG n=12, and 2·5 mg/kg n=33). 54 (46%) of 117 participants were male and 63 (54%) were female. Participants were mainly European. The 0·1 mg/kg dose and the 1·5 mg/kg dose were progressively dropped from the study. At 12 months, the mean ln(AUC C-peptide + 1) was 0·411 nmol/L per min (SD 0·032) in the placebo group and 0·535 nmol/L per min (0·032) in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group. The mean difference in the ln(AUC C-peptide + 1) between 2·5 mg/kg ATG and placebo was 0·124 nmol/L per min (95% CI 0·043-0·205; p=0·0028). At 12 months, the mean ln(AUC C-peptide + 1) in the 0·5 mg/kg ATG group, the remaining middle dose, was 0·513 nmol/L per min (SD 0·032), with a mean baseline-adjusted difference from placebo of 0·102 nmol/L per min (95% CI 0·021-0·183; p=0·014). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 11 (33%) of 33 participants in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group, eight (24%) of 34 in the 0·5mg/kg ATG group, and no participants in the placebo group. Serum sickness occurred in 27 (82%) participants in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group, 11 (32%) in the 0·5 mg/kg ATG group, and no participants in the placebo group. There were no deaths related to adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In young people with recent-onset, clinical type 1 diabetes, 2·5 mg/kg and 0·5 mg/kg ATG reduced loss of β-cell function, showing the potential of an affordable, repurposed agent, ATG, in a low and safe dose, as a disease-modifying agent in this population.

However, the absence of validated predictive models remains a significant challenge. OBJECTIVE: This study compared a conventional logistic regression model with machine learning (ML) models using demographic and clinical data to predict outcomes at 2 and 6 months of treatment for MDR/RR-TB. The goal was to advance model applications, refine control strategies, and boost MDR/RR-TB cure rates. METHODS: This retrospective study encompassed an internal cohort of 744 patients with MDR/RR-TB examined between January 2017 and June 2023, as well as an external cohort comprising 137 patients with MDR/RR-TB examined between March 2021 and June 2022. Data on culture conversion were collected at 2 and 6 months, and culture conversion was tracked in the external cohort at the same time points. The internal cohort was assigned as the training set, whereas the external cohort was used as the validation set. Logistic regression and 7 ML models were developed to predict the culture conversion of patients with MDR/RR-TB at 2 and 6 months of treatment. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: In the internal cohort, culture conversion rates for MDR/RR-TB were 81.9% (485/592) at 2 months and 87.1% (406/466) at 6 months. The odds ratio for treatment success was 8.55 (95% CI 3.31-22.08) at 2 months and 20.33 (95% CI 6.90-59.86) at 6 months after conversion, with sensitivities of 86.5% and 92.2% and specificities of 57.1% and 63.2%, respectively. The artificial neural network model was the best for culture conversion at both 2 and 6 months of treatment, with areas under the curve of 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.86) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.93), respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were 0.74, 0.74, and 0.75 at 2 months of treatment and 0.80, 0.79, and 0.87 at 6 months of treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The ML models based on 2- and 6-month culture conversion could accurately predict treatment outcomes for patients with MDR/RR-TB. ML models, particularly the artificial neural network model, outperformed the logistic regression model in both stability and generalizability and offer a rapid and effective tool for evaluating therapeutic efficacy in the early stages of MDR/RR-TB treatment.",Journal of medical Internet research,22/09/2025

Understanding the mechanisms by which denervation drives muscle atrophy is crucial for developing therapies against neurogenic muscle atrophy. Here, we identified muscle-secreted fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a key inducer of atrophy following muscle denervation. In denervated skeletal muscles, Fgf21 is the most robustly upregulated member of the Fgf family and acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to promote muscle atrophy. Silencing Fgf21 in muscle prevents denervation-induced muscle wasting by preserving neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation. Conversely, forced expression of FGF21 in muscle reduces NMJ innervation, leading to muscle atrophy. Mechanistically, TGFB1 released by denervated fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) upregulates Fgf21 expression through the JNK/c-Jun axis. The resulting increase in FGF21 protein reduces the cytoplasmic level of histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), culminating in muscle atrophy. HDAC4 knockdown abolishes the atrophy-resistant effects observed in Fgf21-deficient denervated muscles, resulting in muscle atrophy. Our findings reveal a novel role and heretofore unrecognized mechanism of FGF21 in skeletal muscle atrophy, suggesting that inhibiting muscular FGF21 could be a promising strategy for mitigating skeletal muscle atrophy.",The Journal of biological chemistry,23/09/2025

Although senescence plays advantageous roles in tissue regeneration and tumor suppression, its accumulation leads to aging-related illnesses and functional deterioration. OBJECTIVE: This review examines the processes of cellular senescence, its effects on aging and age-related disorders, and emerging therapeutic strategies to modulate senescence for promoting healthy aging. METHODS: A thorough literature review was performed using peer-reviewed studies on cellular senescence, its molecular pathways, and therapeutic interventions. Emphasis was placed on senolytics, senomorphics, and lifestyle interventions that modulate senescence-associated pathways. Studies published in Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed between 2014-2025 were selected. RESULTS: Recent discoveries underscore the dual function of cellular senescence in aging and pathology. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) fosters chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction, connecting senescence to age-related diseases including cardiovascular conditions, dementia, and metabolic disorders. Therapeutic strategies, including senolytics (drugs that specifically eradicate senescent cells) and senomorphics (compounds that suppress SASP without killing cells), show promise in preclinical and clinical studies. Notably, dosing interals (intermittent vs continuous) influence both therapeutic efficacy and adverse events such as thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the state and limitations of clinical validation of aging biomarkers (eg, p16^INK4a, β-galactosidase) remain major hurdles for translation. Lifestyle interventions such as calorie restriction and exercise have also been identified as natural modulators of senescence pathways. CONCLUSION: Targeting cellular senescence offers a promising avenue for promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-linked diseases. Continued research into senescence-modulating interventions may lead to novel therapeutics designed to prolong healthspan and lifespan.","Drug design, development and therapy",01/01/2025

Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. Immunogenicity and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were measured via flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Tumor suppression mechanisms were investigated using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. Ferroptosis markers (lipid peroxidation, iron, ROS) were detected using MDA, BODIPY 581/591 C11, FerroOrange, and DCFH-DA probes. Upstream ferroptosis mechanisms were analyzed by Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation, key molecule modulator administration, and SCD1 overexpression. RESULTS: We demonstrated that targeting DDR1 potentiated CIR by triggering ferroptosis-mediated immunogenic cell death, which in turn enhanced antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, DDR1 sustained tumor cell survival by forming 14-3-3-mediated assembly of a DDR1/14-3-3/Akt ternary complex, thereby activating the Akt/mTORC1/SREBP1/SCD1 axis to promote monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthesis and suppress ferroptosis. Silencing DDR1 disrupted this complex, alleviating MUFA-mediated ferroptosis inhibition and subsequently increasing tumor immunogenicity. This immunogenic shift facilitated CD8 + T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity, amplifying CIR-induced tumor suppression. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 using the small-molecule inhibitor 7rh recapitulated these effects, demonstrating potent anti-proliferative and ferroptosis-inducing capabilities, enhancing CIR sensitivity to better control tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings positioned DDR1 targeting as a therapeutic strategy to potentiate CIR through immunogenic ferroptosis induction in HNSCC.",Journal of translational medicine,24/09/2025

Depletion experiments in cell line models have suggested that their continued expression is required for maintaining their leukemic phenotype and that fusion genes therefore represent ideal cancer-specific therapeutic targets. However, to which extent this result holds true for the different stages of hematopoietic development in primary cells and whether therapeutic agents can be efficiently delivered to those cells is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that primary AML cells harboring the chromosomal translocation t(8;21) are critically dependent on the corresponding fusion gene, RUNX1::RUNX1T1, to suppress differentiation and maintain stemness. Silencing RUNX1::RUNX1T1 expression using siRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles induces substantial changes in chromatin accessibility, thereby redirecting the leukemia-associated transcriptional network towards a myeloid differentiation program. Single-cell analyses reveal that this transcriptional reprogramming is associated with the depletion of immature stem and progenitor-like cell populations, accompanied by an expansion of granulocytic and eosinophilic/mast cell-like populations with impaired self-renewal capacity. These findings underscore the essential role of RUNX1::RUNX1T1 in sustaining AML and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting fusion gene expression in primary AML cells.",Blood,24/09/2025

Here, we identified MEN1 as a driver of ferroptosis in lung cancer. MEN1 facilitated lipid ROS generation and sensitized lung cancer cells to ferroptosis by perturbing CD44 precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. CD44 variant isoforms were highly expressed and correlated with poor prognosis in human lung cancers. Loss of Men1 profoundly accelerated the progression of mutant Kras driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and promoted the accumulation of CD44 variant isoforms. Mechanistically, MEN1 maintained a relatively slow RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation by controlling the release of PAF1 from the CD44 pre-mRNA, which in turn prevented the inclusion of CD44 variable exons (CD44v). Furthermore, CD44v6-interfering peptides effectively abrogated the growth and metastasis of established MEN1 deficient tumors by activating ferroptosis. Collectively, this study unveils a mechanism of tumor suppression based on MEN1 regulation of CD44 alternative splicing, ROS production, and ferroptosis induction.",Cancer research,24/09/2025

Here, a novel mitochondrial localization of Nestin in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is identified, where it functions as a critical protector against mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence. It is demonstrated that Nestin is imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space via its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence through Translocase of the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 20 (TOM20)-dependent machinery. Within mitochondria, Nestin directly interacts with Mic60 to maintain cristae architecture and sustain oxidative phosphorylation. Genetic ablation of mitochondrial Nestin triggers cristae disorganization, respiratory deficiency, and premature senescence in hMSCs. Strikingly, targeted restoration of the Mic60-binding Tail3 domain of Nestin is sufficient to rescue cristae morphology, mitochondrial function, and senescence phenotypes. These findings establish a non-filamentous role for Nestin in mitochondrial quality control and propose a new therapeutic strategy for age-related disorders through modulation of mitochondrial Nestin-Mic60 interactions.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025
10.2196/49348,Selection of Behavior Change Techniques for Asthma Medication Adherence Apps: Evidence-Based Design Study.,"Wright AJ, Holland J, Simpson I, Walker S, Bennett-Steele N, Weinman J","BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence is a widespread issue that causes adverse patient outcomes and is expensive for all aspects of the health care system. Developing cost-effective and scalable interventions to promote medication adherence is a key goal. Mobile apps hold promise as a mode of delivery for adherence interventions, but app design rarely takes into account the behavioral influences on nonadherence with sufficient rigor. As a result, apps may not realize their full potential in enhancing adherence. Medication nonadherence is common among adults prescribed preventer inhalers for asthma and has a variety of influences, creating a need to identify what components behavior change technique (BCT) apps should include to effectively tackle each influence. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the most acceptable and practicable BCTs to include in a medication adherence app targeting factors that influence preventer inhaler adherence in adults with asthma. METHODS: Key influences on preventer inhaler adherence in adults with asthma were identified based on reviews of peer-reviewed and gray literature and domain expert knowledge. These influences were then mapped to a published set of 26 mechanisms of action (MoAs) of behavior change interventions. Next, candidate BCTs to change each MoA were identified using the Theory and Techniques tool, a web-based resource that reflects almost 100 expert behavioral scientists' consensus about which BCTs are most likely to change particular MoAs. Finally, candidate BCTs were filtered by considering their potential acceptability and practicability. RESULTS: A total of 31 influences on preventer inhaler adherence were identified and coded to 15/26 of the influences on behavior listed by the Theory and Techniques tool. The initial mapping of influences on behavior to candidate BCTs to change those influences identified 41 candidate BCTs. After considering the potential acceptability and practicability of the candidate BCTs, the number of BCTs suggested for inclusion was reduced to 24. CONCLUSIONS: Using an evidence-based approach, this study identified 24 BCTs that may be particularly useful to include in apps promoting adherence to preventer inhalers in order to target particular influences on adherence. The list can be used by app developers to improve the quality of adherence behavior change support that their apps provide or by health care decision-makers to identify which apps contain elements addressing a range of adherence difficulties.",JMIR mHealth and uHealth,23/09/2025

Clinical bedaquiline resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has rapidly emerged, primarily due to mutations in the transcriptional repressor Rv0678 that result in upregulation of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) efflux pump MmpS5/MmpL5 (MmpS5L5). Here, to understand how MmpS5L5 effluxes bedaquiline, we determined the structure of the MmpS5L5 complex using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing a trimeric architecture distinct from the canonical tripartite RND efflux pumps of gram-negative bacteria. Structure prediction modeling in conjunction with functional genetic analysis indicates that it uses a periplasmic coiled-coil tube to transport molecules across the cell wall. Structure-guided genetic approaches identify MmpL5 mutations that alter bedaquiline transport; these mutations converge on a region in MmpL5 located in the lower portion of the periplasmic cavity, proximal to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane, suggesting a route for bedaquiline entry into the pump. While currently known clinical resistance to bedaquiline is due to pump upregulation, our findings that several MmpL5 variants increase bedaquiline efflux may presage the emergence of additional modes of clinical resistance.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025

While semaglutide reduces adipose tissue, there is also a loss of lean mass including skeletal muscle, though it is unclear whether this translates to a loss of muscle function. The effect of discontinuation of semaglutide on rebound weight gain and shifts in body composition is also not well understood. We investigated the impact of semaglutide and matched caloric restriction on body composition in mice with diet-induced obesity. Mice were treated with semaglutide or fed a calorie-matched diet for 4 weeks. Semaglutide and pair-feeding induced significant weight loss with a concomitant reduction in energy expenditure. Weight loss was greater with semaglutide than caloric restriction, despite matched energy intake. Muscle transcriptomic analyses revealed distinct molecular responses between semaglutide and pair-feeding. In a follow-up experiment, semaglutide and pair-feeding was discontinued after 4 weeks, and body weight and food intake were tracked for 6 weeks. At the end of the withdrawal period there was a loss of treatment effects. Lean and fat mass rebounded to baseline levels at the end of the withdrawal period. Muscle size and strength were also comparable between groups. These findings demonstrate that semaglutide reduces muscle size and strength to the same extent as caloric restriction but may be more effective at promoting fat loss. Interestingly, the loss of lean mass and skeletal muscle recovered following treatment discontinuation. KEY POINTS: Semaglutide results in greater weight loss than caloric restriction. Semaglutide treatment increases fat loss compared with caloric restriction. Muscle mass and strength is reduced to a similar extent by semaglutide and restricted feeding.",The Journal of physiology,22/09/2025

However, numerous patients with PDAC develop resistance to gemcitabine, highlighting the need to identify sensitizers or resistance targets. In this study, we constructed a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model using resected PDAC tissue from patients and established stable gemcitabine-resistant and -sensitive PDX models. RNA sequencing analysis of the gemcitabine-resistant PDX model and cell lines revealed that altered iron ion metabolism significantly affected gemcitabine resistance in PDAC. Gemcitabine-resistant cell lines exhibited altered iron ion levels, which contributed to decreasing lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. To identify biomarkers of gemcitabine resistance, we established PDX-based machine learning features and found that they may differentiate the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in different patients. TXNRD1 was identified as a potential oncogene that promotes cell migration and proliferation, while inhibiting cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, TXNRD1 knockdown restricted P65 expression and phosphorylation, leading to SLC7A11 depletion and enhanced ferroptosis. This activated ferroptosis, induced by SLC7A11 inhibition, further suppressed gemcitabine resistance in PDAC. Auranofin, a TXNRD1 inhibitor, induced ferroptosis and exerted synergistic effects with gemcitabine in PDAC therapy. Auranofin additionally enhanced the anticancer effects of gemcitabine in a drug-resistant PDAC PDX model. Collectively, TXNRD1 is a potential target for overcoming gemcitabine resistance. Auranofin can inhibit TXNRD1 activation, thereby sensitizing PDAC cells to gemcitabine. Combination therapy with auranofin and gemcitabine may have translational potential for PDAC chemotherapy.",Cancer letters,20/09/2025

The unique metabolic landscape of TNBC, characterized by elevated iron and lipid levels, renders it particularly susceptible to ferroptosis, positioning this cell death modality as a promising therapeutic avenue. Eriocalyxin B (Eri B), a natural diterpenoid, exhibits multifaceted anticancer properties that warrant further investigation. OBJECT: To elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of Eri B-induced ferroptosis in TNBC. METHOD: In this study, the anti-proliferative effects of Eri B on TNBC cells were evaluated using cell colony formation assays, three-dimensional tumor sphere formation assays, EdU incorporation assays, and analysis of the proliferation marker Ki-67. The anti-metastatic potential of Eri B was assessed through wound healing assays, transwell migration assays, immunofluorescence staining, and western blot analysis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy, and western blotting demonstrated that Eri B induces ferroptosis in TNBC cells. Molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) provided evidence of a direct interaction between Eri B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Moreover, the efficacy and underlying mechanism of Eri B were further validated through SIRT3 overexpression experiments and by employing a STAT3 activator, colivelin. In vivo anti-TNBC activity was confirmed using a xenografted tumor model combined with bioluminescence imaging. RESULT: For the first time, we demonstrate that Eri B exhibits significant antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo through the induction of ferroptosis. RNA-seq analysis enabled us to identify and confirm that Eri B induces ferroptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which subsequently modulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) signaling pathway. Moreover, our findings reveal that Eri B suppresses SIRT3 transcription by directly targeting STAT3, thereby regulating the SIRT3-sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) -mediated fatty acid metabolism and cellular redox homeostasis. CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings suggest that Eri B functions as a novel inducer of ferroptosis in TNBC, demonstrating potential therapeutic value through the inhibition of SIRT3 in TNBC.",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,11/09/2025

We aim to investigate the genetic overlap and causality of depression with PTB. METHODS: Leveraging summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association studies for broad depression (N(total) = 807,533), major depression (N(total) = 173,005), bipolar disorder (N(total) = 414,466), and PTB (N(total) = 226,330), we conducted a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis to assess global and local genetic correlations, identify pleiotropic loci, and infer potential causal relationships. RESULTS: Positive genetic correlations were observed between PTB and broad depression (r(g) = 0.242), major depression (r(g) = 0.236), and bipolar disorder (r(g) = 0.133) using the linkage disequilibrium score regression, which were further verified by the genetic covariance analyzer. Local genetic correlation was identified at chromosome 11q22.3 (harbors NCAM1-TTC12-ANKK1-DRD2) for PTB with depression. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified two loci shared between PTB and broad depression, two loci shared with major depression, and five loci shared with bipolar disorder, among which three were novel (rs7813444, rs3132948 and rs9273363). Mendelian randomization demonstrated a significantly increased risk of PTB for genetic liability to broad depression (odds ratio [OR]=1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.52) and major depression (OR=1.27; 95%CI: 1.08-1.49), and the estimates remained significant across the sensitivity analyses.

However, the mechanisms through which Piezo1 regulates chondrocytes and affects endochondral ossification remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Piezo1 in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification. Using lineage tracing, we identified chondrocyte-to-osteoblast transdifferentiation during endochondral ossification, which was impaired by chondrocyte-specific Piezo1 knockout. Piezo1 deficiency disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics, characterized by diminished membrane potential, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, suppressed oxygen consumption rates (basal and maximal respiration), and elevated mitochondrial superoxide generation, thereby impairing endochondral ossification during fracture healing. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed upregulated Lars2 expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes following Piezo1 knockout. Inhibition of Lars2 in chondrocytes normalized mitochondrial dynamics-related markers (MFN1, MFN2, OPA1, DRP1) and restored mitochondrial functional homeostasis. This intervention concurrently reversed Piezo1 knockout-induced suppression of osteogenic markers (Col1, ALP, OCN, OPN, RUNX2), thereby enhancing fracture repair. Protein interaction analyses confirmed direct binding between β-catenin and Lars2. Mechanistically, Piezo1 governs Lars2 expression via β-catenin signaling. Our findings demonstrate that Piezo1 activation via Yoda1 enhances mitochondrial bioenergetics and accelerates fracture repair through the β-catenin/Lars2 axis, offering novel insights and therapeutic avenues for fracture treatment.",Bone research,24/09/2025

In all eukaryotes, polyubiquitin precursors are generated and processed into ubiquitin monomers. The final ubiquitin unit always contains a C-terminal extension, but its physiological significance is unknown. Here, we show that C-terminally extended ubiquitin, termed CxUb, is essential for stress resistance, mitophagy, and longevity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans. CxUb forms ubiquitin chains and binds to a previously undescribed region within the ubiquitin chain-elongating E4 enzyme Ufd2, which also functions during stress and aging. Ufd2 recognizes CxUb and conjugates it to substrate proteins, triggering their degradation. By contrast, CxUb is not required for basal housekeeping functions of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These data suggest that the CxUb encodes a functionally unique ubiquitin form, specialized for proteostasis defects, expanding the code of post-translational modification processes.",Molecular cell,23/09/2025

Deciphering epigenetic regulation of ferroptosis could provide insights into effective approaches for enhancing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Here, we identified CRB2 as an epigenetic modulator of ferroptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). CRB2 expression correlated with expression of ferroptosis-related genes and improved prognosis in HNSCC patients. Ferroptosis inducers Erastin and RSL3 significantly increased CRB2 expression, and overexpression of CRB2 sensitized HNSCC to ferroptosis to suppress growth in vitro and in vivo. CRB2 upregulation led to an increase in dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2) in the promoter region of the ferroptosis inhibitor SLC7A11, which epigenetically inhibited its transcription and induced ferroptosis in HNSCC. Mechanistically, CRB2 hindered the interaction between the E8A isoform of the histone lysine demethylase LSD1 and the deubiquitinase USP7, thereby facilitating degradation of LSD1(E8A) and subsequently increasing H4K20me2 levels. Taken together, these results indicate that CRB2 stimulates ferroptosis by activating an epigenetic axis, suggesting upregulation of CRB2 as a potential therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.",Cancer research,24/09/2025

With the advent of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) targeting ubiquitin enzymes, precision therapies are now possible. Therefore, it is imperative to ascertain the prognostic significance of ubiquitination-related genes in ovarian cancer. METHODS: A prognostic model based on ubiquitination-related genes was developed using data from TCGA and GTEx databases. Performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier, ROC curves, and Cox regression; a nomogram was created. The model's stability was checked using training and test sets. FBXO45 was also experimentally validated in ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The model, based on 17 genes related to ubiquitination, showed high performance (1-year AUC = 0.703, 3-year AUC = 0.704, 5-year AUC = 0.705). The high-risk group had significantly lower overall survival (P < 0.05). Immune analysis showed higher levels of CD8+ T (P < 0.05), M1 (P < 0.01) and follicular (P < 0.05) cells in the low-risk group. High-risk patients had more mutations in MUC17 and LRRK2, while low-risk patients had more RYR2 mutations. FBXO45 is a key E3 ubiquitin ligase in ovarian cancer, promoting growth, spread and migration via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

METHODS: We used LPS to stimulate primary microglia in vitro and performed stereotactic injection of LPS into the substantia nigra of mice in vivo to investigate changes in DJ-1 expression following inflammatory stimulation. To evaluate the functional effects of DJ-1 on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, we used siRNA to knock down DJ-1 in primary microglia or BMDMs and analyzed downstream inflammatory responses as well as the specificity of this regulation. In vivo, we used microglia-specific AAV to selectively silence DJ-1 in the substantia nigra to further evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of DJ-1 deficiency. To validate the direct interaction between DJ-1 and NLRP3, we performed co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. We used the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and activator rapamycin to investigate how NLRP3 is degraded upon DJ-1 deficiency in CRISPR-Cas9-engineered DJ-1 knockout HEK-293 cells. RESULTS: DJ-1 were significantly upregulated following LPS or LPS plus ATP stimulation in primary microglia. Similarly, after stereotactic LPS injection into the substantia nigra, we observed a significant upregulation of DJ-1 expression. Knockdown of microglial DJ-1 markedly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, as evidenced by reduced mature caspase-1 and decreased IL-1β secretion. We confirmed this phenomenon in BMDM and found that DJ-1 knockdown specifically inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, with no effect on NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes. In vivo, microglia-specific DJ-1 knockdown significantly attenuated microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the substantia nigra and exerted neuroprotective effects after LPS treatment. Furthermore, DJ-1 was found to directly bind NLRP3 and stabilize its conformation, thereby preventing autophagic degradation. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that DJ-1 deficiency in microglia inhibits NLRP3-driven inflammation by promoting NLRP3 degradation through the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Future studies should focus on identifying the specific binding sites and structure of DJ-1 with NLRP3, as well as investigating whether inhibiting DJ-1 in microglia could serve as a potential therapeutic target for suppressing neuroinflammation in Parkinson's disease.",Frontiers in immunology,01/01/2025

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between isoniazid tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT), compared to no treatment, upon incident tuberculosis in household contacts of MDR tuberculosis cases using a large global consortium of tuberculosis contact tracing studies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis among observational studies of household contact tracing studies. Participants were included if they were exposed to someone with MDR-tuberculosis and were given either 6 months of isoniazid TPT or no TPT. Our primary outcome was incident tuberculosis in contacts exposed to tuberculosis. We derived adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using mixed-effects, multivariable survival regression models with study-level random effects. The effectiveness of isoniazid TPT against incident tuberculosis was estimated through propensity score matching. We stratified our results by contact age, background tuberculosis burden, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included participant-level data from 6,668 contacts exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from 17 countries. The effectiveness of isoniazid TPT against incident tuberculosis in contacts of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was 57% (aHR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.71) and did not appreciably change with adjustment for additional potential confounders. The reduction in incident tuberculosis was marginally greater among child (<20 years old) contacts (0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92) compared to adult contacts (0.69; 95% CI, 0.22-2.20). The reduction in incidence was 73% (0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.70) in the first year of follow-up; effectiveness dropped to 60% (0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-1.06) from 12-23 months of follow-up and was non-significant after two years (28% effectiveness; 0.72; 95% CI, 0.33-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: Among over 6,500 contacts of MDR-tuberculosis, isoniazid TPT was highly effective in preventing incident tuberculosis. The reduction was greatest in high-burden countries and waned after 2 years of follow-up.",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,23/09/2025

Lgr5-expressing cancer stem cells fuel the growth of the primary tumor and metastasis, yet disseminated tumor cells arriving at the metastatic site and seeding liver metastases are devoid of Lgr5 expression. Using CRC organoid models, we demonstrate that mechanical interactions with collagen I, a main constituent of the interstitial matrix, instruct the reprogramming of CRC cells. Collagen I-induced pulling forces are sensed by integrins and mechanosensitive calcium channels, which together direct the transition of CRC cells into a cellular state with transcriptional similarities to fetal intestinal cells. CRC cells infiltrating the interstitial stroma show upregulation of this fetal-like transcriptional program, which correlates with the ability of Lgr5-negative cells to initiate metastasis formation. Our findings indicate that mechanical interactions with collagen I regulate cell fate transitions associated with the metastatic cascade of CRC.",Cell reports,22/09/2025

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the effects of CLDN18.2 expression on the outcomes of first-line ICI-containing chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative, pMMR, and PD-L1-expressing mGC/GEJC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with HER2-negative, pMMR, and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) ⩾1 unresectable/metastatic or recurrent GC/GEJC who received first-line ICI-chemo or chemotherapy alone (chemo-alone) between January 2016 and August 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. The impact of CLDN18.2 status on the clinical outcomes was evaluated in patients receiving ICI-chemo and chemo-alone to assess the prognostic significance of CLDN18.2 in the absence of ICI. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were treated with ICI-chemo, whereas 313 patients received chemo-alone. CLDN18.2 positivity (⩾2+ in ⩾75% tumor cells) was identified in 42 patients (28.0%) in the ICI-chemo group and 94 patients (30.0%) in the chemo-alone group. There were no significant differences in the objective response rate (ORR; 68.3% vs 70.3%, p = 0.842), disease control rate (DCR; 92.7% vs 94.1%, p = 0.718), progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, p = 0.955), or overall survival (OS; HR 1.12, p = 0.615) between CLDN18.2-positive and CLDN18.2-negative patients in the ICI-chemo group. Similarly, the DCR, ORR, PFS, and OS outcomes were comparable between the CLDN18.2-positive and -negative patients in the chemo-alone group.

DESIGN: Multicentre, open label, randomised controlled trial SETTING: Three tertiary neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in southeast India. POPULATION: Newborn babies weighing <2000 g. 7067 were assessed for eligibility and 5420 were randomised (2714 BCG-OPV, 2706 control). INTERVENTIONS: Newborns were randomised 1:1 to receive 0.1 mL of BCG Danish intradermally plus OPV, either within 48 hours of admission to the NICU (early vaccination group) or delayed until at least the time of discharge (control group). Stratification was by NICU, sex, and birth weight (<1000 g, 1000-1499 g, 1500-1999 g). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was all cause neonatal mortality. The main secondary outcome, included a third of the way through the trial, was neonatal mortality due to infection. RESULTS: Of the 5420 newborn babies randomised at a median age of 0.9 days and with a median birth weight of 1560 g, nine were lost to follow-up. Deaths occurred in 238 (8.8%) of 2714 newborn babies in the early vaccination group and 273 (10.1%) of 2706 in the control group. In intention-to-treat Cox survival analysis stratified by NICU and adjusted for postnatal age, birth weight, sex, and gestational age, neonatal mortality per person year was 1.29 in the early vaccination group and 1.50 in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.98; P=0.03). The number needed to treat to prevent one death was 21 (95% CI 10 to 245). Infection related neonatal mortality per person year was 0.40 in the early vaccination group and 0.73 in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.70). No deaths from tuberculosis occurred, and no serious adverse effects were associated with vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In newborn babies weighing <2000 g in intensive care, BCG-OPV administered at a median age of 0.9 days reduced all cause neonatal mortality owing to a decrease in deaths due to infections other than tuberculosis (a non-specific or off-target effect). A substantial reduction in neonatal mortality could be achieved if a skilled administrator vaccinated a high proportion of newborn babies in high mortality settings on the day of, or soon after, birth.

The development of targeted therapies, specifically tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene alterations, has significantly improved treatment outcomes. METHODS: This article reports and evaluates the efficacy of different generations of TKIs for NSCLC with BMs. The primary endpoints assessed are intracranial objective response rates (IC-ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The analysis considers TKIs as monotherapy and in combination with radiotherapy. It also examines the impact of newer generation TKIs with enhanced blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration on intracranial control. The report further discusses the integration of systemic therapy with local modalities like stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and the safety profiles of these agents, including central nervous system (CNS) and metabolic adverse events. RESULTS: Newer generation TKIs demonstrate significantly enhanced BBB penetration, resulting in superior intracranial control compared to older generations. These agents show remarkable intracranial activity, contributing to improved IC-ORR, PFS, and OS. The optimal integration of systemic therapy with local modalities, such as SRS, is still under investigation. Treatment with these TKIs is associated with distinct safety profiles, including novel CNS and metabolic adverse events, which require careful management due to prolonged treatment durations. CONCLUSIONS: The management of CNS metastases in NSCLC is evolving towards more proactive and personalized therapeutic strategies. Newer generation TKIs have profoundly reshaped the treatment landscape by offering superior intracranial control. Further research is needed to determine the optimal integration of these systemic therapies with local modalities and to effectively manage the associated adverse events.","Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",18/09/2025

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the replacement of clotting factors with frozen plasma (FP) or factor concentrates (fibrinogen concentrate [FC] and prothrombin complex concentrate [PCC]) in the initial resuscitation of patients with trauma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, parallel-control, superiority randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 level I trauma centers in Canada, between April 2021 and February 2023. Eligible patients were those with massive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) activation on admission and aged 16 years or older. Patients were excluded if they received more than 2 red blood cell (RBC) units either before hospital admission or in the hospital prior to randomization or if they had a catastrophic head injury. Follow-up was completed on March 25, 2023. The primary analysis was based on the modified intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group received FC 4 g and PCC 2000 IU in MHP packs 1 and 2. The control group received 4 FP units. Concurrently, patients received 4 RBC units (both packs) and 1 dose of platelets (pack 2). After pack 2, FP was administered at clinician discretion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was the number of allogeneic blood product (RBC, FP, and platelet) units administered within 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included incidence of thromboembolic events, duration of intensive care unit stay, and mortality. RESULTS: Of the 217 patients enrolled, 107 were randomly assigned to the FC-PCC group and 110 to the FP group; 137 patients were included in the primary analysis (66 in the FC-PCC group and 71 in the FP group). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups (median [IQR] age, 38 [29-55] years; 111 males [81.0%]). Among these patients, 95 (69.3%) had blunt mechanisms of injury, and the median (IQR) Injury Severity Score was 29 (19-43). Mean 24-hour transfusions were 20.8 (95% CI, 16.7-25.9) units in the FC-PCC group and 23.8 (95% CI, 19.2-29.4) units in the FP group. The mean ratio was 0.87 (1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-1.19; P = .20 for superiority). No significant differences were found in thromboembolic complications or 24-hour and 28-day mortality. The trial was terminated after the interim analysis showed conditional power of less than 25%, requiring an impractically large sample to show superiority. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, clotting factor concentrates were not superior to FP for initial resuscitation of patients with trauma.

This study aims to investigate the association between BRI and the likelihood of developing COPD. METHODS: This study was conducted based on data from the 2013-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified as having COPD if they met any of the following criteria: (i) self-reported physician diagnosis of COPD; (ii) physician-confirmed diagnosis of emphysema; or (iii) physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. Those who responded ""no"" to all of the above were categorized as non-COPD. To assess the association between BRI and COPD, weighted logistic regression models, subgroup analyses, and interaction tests were employed. The dose-response relationship was investigated using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model. RESULTS: A total of 14,254 individuals were included. The overall weighted prevalence of COPD was 8.3%. After adjusting for multiple confounders, continuous BRI was found to be positively associated with COPD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.140, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.033-1.259, P = 0.012). The RCS analysis confirmed a linear dose-response relationship between BRI and COPD. Subgroup analyses demonstrated substantial heterogeneity across sex, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease subgroups, indicating that the association between BRI and COPD may be impacted by these factors. CONCLUSION: Higher BRI levels were positively associated with an increased likelihood of developing COPD among US adults. Our study suggests that BRI holds promise as a tool for assessing the odds of having COPD.",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,01/01/2025

This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of candesartan for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. METHODS: This randomised, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 2 trial was done at nine hospitals across Norway and one large hospital in Estonia, selected for their neurological services and research capacity. Adults aged 18-64 years, experiencing between two and eight migraine attacks (with or without aura) per month were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive oral candesartan 16 mg, candesartan 8 mg, or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Acute migraine medication was permitted during the trial but the use of other preventive treatments were prohibited. Participants, site personnel, and the trial statistician were all masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the change in the mean number of migraine days per 4 weeks from baseline to weeks 9-12, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (participants with at least one post-baseline measurement during the masked treatment period). Safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of the trial drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04574713; Oct 5, 2020) and is completed. FINDINGS: Between April 9, 2021, and April 12, 2024, 1340 individuals were assessed for eligibility, 806 were deemed ineligible, and 534 were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 77 were excluded, and 457 participants were randomly assigned to candesartan 16 mg (n=156), candesartan 8 mg (n=150), or placebo (n=151). The mean age of the trial population was 38·7 years (SD 10·0); 391 (86%) participants were female and 66 (14%) were male. The mean number of migraine days was 5·7 (SD 2·5) at baseline. By weeks 9-12, the reduction in migraine days was 2·04 days (95% CI 1·65-2·41 p<0·0001) in the candesartan 16 mg group compared with 0·82 days (0·38-1·23; p=0·0003) in the placebo group ((difference between groups -1·22 [95% CI -1·75 to -0·70]; p<0·0001). The most common adverse event with candesartan 16 mg was dizziness, reported in 46 (30%) of 156 participants, compared with 19 (13%) of 151 in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in four (3%) participants in the candesartan 16 mg group and one (1%) participant in the placebo group. Adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in four (3%) participants in both the candesartan 16 mg and placebo groups. INTERPRETATION: Daily administration of candesartan 16 mg is effective and well tolerated as a preventive treatment for episodic migraine. These findings support its role as a clinically meaningful and evidence-based option for migraine prevention. However, further clinical trials and real-world data from registry studies are necessary to assess its long-term efficacy. FUNDING: Norwegian Research Council.",The Lancet. Neurology,01/10/2025

Previously, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), the source cells of myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system, have been linked to brain aging by their compromised differentiation and regeneration capability. Whether a myelination-independent function of OPCs is involved in brain aging remains unknown. In this study, we herein report a myelination-independent role of OPCs in exaggerating cognitive decline in the aging brain via suppressing neuronal plasticity. Our results demonstrate that macroautophagic flux declines in aged OPCs. Inactivation of autophagy promotes the senescence of OPCs, which activates C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3)/CCL5-C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 signaling. Through this, autophagy-defective OPCs impair glutamatergic transmission, neuronal excitability, and long-term potentiation, exaggerating the cognitive decline in the aging brain. Our study demonstrates a myelination-independent role of OPCs in brain aging and identifies that a declined autophagy in OPCs is a pivotal factor in driving aging-associated cognitive decline.",Science advances,26/09/2025

The regulators of immunosurveillance of CRLM could hold potential for developing therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat metastasis. Here, using a murine colorectal cancer (CRC) organoid-based transplantation mode, we identified TYK2 as a key factor controlling CRLM. Evaluation of the effects of Tyk2 deletion in different subsets of immune cells and in CRC cells demonstrated that TYK2 was not required in cancer cells, macrophages, NK cells, T cells, or Kupffer cells. Instead, TYK2 controlled CRLM via a dendritic cell-dependent mechanism that relied on MHC-I-mediated cross presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from primary CRC and CRLM revealed that TYK2 was predominantly expressed in a dendritic cell population destined to present antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes. Treatment with the TYK2 inhibitor deucravacitinib, which is approved by the FDA for treating plaque psoriasis and is under clinical investigation for other autoimmune diseases, promoted CRLM. Together, these data demonstrate that TYK2 controls CRLM immunosurveillance, which should be carefully considered when treating patients with TYK2 inhibitors.",Cancer research,24/09/2025

The Mediterranean diet is known for its anti-inflammatory and cardiometabolic benefits, which may be relevant to psoriasis pathophysiology. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a 16-week Mediterranean diet intervention would improve psoriasis severity in patients with mild to moderate disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: MEDIPSO (Impact of the Mediterranean Diet on Patients With Psoriasis), an open-label, single-center, single-blinded (evaluator) randomized clinical trial, was conducted from February 2024 to March 2025 at a dermatology referral clinic in Madrid, Spain. Participants were adults with mild to moderate psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] of 2-10, with higher scores indicating maximal disease) receiving stable topical therapy. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized 1:1 to the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a 16-week, dietitian-guided Mediterranean diet program, including nutritional counseling, educational materials, and weekly provision of extra virgin olive oil. The control group received standard low-fat dietary advice without dietitian supervision. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the change in the PASI from baseline to week 16. Secondary outcomes included changes in Mediterranean diet adherence, anthropometric and metabolic parameters, serum inflammatory cytokines, and patient-reported outcomes. Estimated marginal means (EMMs) at baseline and for the change from baseline to week 16 were reported, with the intervention effect presented as the between-group difference. RESULTS: Among 45 individuals screened, 38 participants were enrolled and randomized (mean [SD] age, 46.4 [12.8] years; 25 males [65.8%]); 19 were randomized to the intervention group and 19 were randomized to the control group; 37 individuals (97.4%) completed the study. The EMM PASI change at week 16 was -3.4 (95% CI, -4.4 to -2.4) in the intervention group and 0.0 (95% CI, -1.0 to 1.0) in the control group; the between-group EMM difference was -3.4 (95% CI, -4.8 to -2.0; P < .001). Nine of 19 participants in the Mediterranean diet group (47.4%) achieved PASI 75 (a 75% reduction in PASI) compared with none in the control group. A significant reduction in EMM hemoglobin A1c (glycated hemoglobin) was observed in the intervention group as compared with the control group (between-group EMM difference, -4.1 mmol/mol [95% CI, -6.9 to -1.3 mmol/mol]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that a 16-week Mediterranean diet intervention significantly improved psoriasis severity in patients with mild to moderate disease receiving stable topical therapy. These findings suggest that incorporating dietary strategies may be beneficial as an adjunctive therapy in psoriasis management.

Here, Odoribacter splanchnicus (O. splanchnicus) is indentified as a taxon depleted in human IBD cohorts and demonstrated its protective effects in acute and chronic murine colitis models. In mice, O. splanchnicus administration alleviated colonic inflammation and preserved barrier integrity, accompanied by a restructured mucosal immune landscape and reduced neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. This inhibitory effect on NETs is lost in Pad4(-/-) mice, highlighting its dependence on NETs formation machinery. Metabolomic profiling showed that O. splanchnicus treatment elevated the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid (LCA). This increase is lost following antibiotic cocktail treatment and restored by fecal microbiota transplantation from O. splanchnicus-treated donors, demonstrating a requirement for an intact gut microbiota. Mechanistically, LCA supplementation recapitulated the anti-NETs formation phenotype and suppressed colonic inflamation by inhibiting the NLRP3-GSDMD signaling pathway. Together, these findings define a gut microbiota-metabolite-neutrophil axis in IBD pathogenesis, highlighting the microbiota-dependent regulation of LCA as a key protective mechanism of O. splanchnicus.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",24/09/2025
10.1002/14651858.CD012503.pub3,Remote ischaemic conditioning for preventing and treating ischaemic stroke.,"Qiao Y, Hui W, Li S, Ding Y, Ji X, Zhao W","RATIONALE: Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) has been innovatively utilised as a neuroprotective method in the prevention and treatment of stroke. RIC typically involves transiently restricting then restoring blood flow to limbs. The current evidence, as derived from various studies, indicates some beneficial effects of RIC, but also highlights the need for further investigation due to the presence of uncertainties and variations in study designs and outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits and harms of remote ischaemic conditioning in preventing and treating ischaemic stroke compared to sham or standard treatments. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, three Chinese databases, five trials registers, and conference proceedings, together with reference checking and citation searching. The latest search date was 11 March 2025. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing RIC with sham RIC or standard medical management, over any length of follow-up, in people with ischaemic stroke. OUTCOMES: Our critical outcomes were mortality, recurrence of ischaemic stroke, and excellent functional outcome (Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1). Our important outcomes were treatment-related adverse events, functional independence (mRS score 0-2), haemorrhagic stroke, stroke severity, improvement in neurological impairment, and cardiovascular events. RISK OF BIAS: We assessed risk of bias using the original Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1). SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used standard Cochrane methodology. We synthesised results for each outcome through meta-analysis where possible, using either the inverse variance or Mantel-Haenszel method with a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. INCLUDED STUDIES: This review included 20 RCTs with 7687 participants, though we analysed two publications from a single RCT as two separate studies. Sixteen RCTs with 7166 participants were new to this update. The studies were conducted in China, Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Romania, and were published between 2012 and 2025. Fourteen studies investigated short-duration RIC, four evaluated medium-duration RIC, and three investigated long-duration RIC. Because studies reported the timing of RIC application after stroke onset in various ways, we made assumptions to combine data, which may have introduced extra heterogeneity or bias and affected the certainty of our conclusions regarding the optimal RIC application timing. We also identified 21 ongoing trials. SYNTHESIS OF RESULTS: The evidence suggests that RIC compared to non-RIC probably results in a slight reduction in the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.98; 16 RCTs, 6828 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and probably has no little to no effect on mortality risk (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.12; 15 RCTs, 7203 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at 90 days (RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.28; 10 RCTs, 3091 participants; low-certainty evidence), but probably has little to no effect on functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.09; 11 RCTs, 3979 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Studies measured improvement in neurological impairment on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the pooled evidence suggests a slight improvement with RIC, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) -0.97, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.21; 12 RCTs, 1341 participants; very low-certainty evidence). RIC compared to non-RIC may result in little to no difference in the risk of intracerebral haemorrhagic events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57; 12 RCTs, 5908 participants; low-certainty evidence) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.08; 8 RCTs, 4357 participants; low-certainty evidence), but may result in a large increase in treatment-related adverse events (RR 6.13, 95% CI 2.85 to 13.18; 17 RCTs, 7274 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-certainty evidence that RIC compared to non-RIC probably reduces recurrence of ischaemic stroke slightly, and low-certainty evidence that RIC may result in a slight increase in excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1). Evidence for improvement in NIHSS scores is very uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision. RIC demonstrated an acceptable harm profile with no increase in intracerebral haemorrhage or mortality; however, treatment-related adverse events were more common. The certainty of evidence was limited by high risk of bias for blinding in most studies, incomplete outcome data in some studies, and imprecision in several outcomes. However, the generalisability of these findings may be limited because 79.3% of participants were from China, highlighting the need for further studies in diverse populations to confirm the results. The optimal timing, duration, and method of RIC administration require further investigation through large, high-quality randomised trials with standardised protocols to establish definitive evidence for clinical practice. This updated analysis includes 16 new RCTs, and these findings highlight the need for ongoing research and careful consideration of study design and methodology in future investigations.

In contrast, the fungal part of the microbiome, the mycobiome, has only rarely been investigated-although anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, an antibody against fungal mannan, have been known for years as a biomarker for Crohn's disease (CD), but not for ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: A systematic review of case-control studies on the human gut mycobiome in IBD was conducted using searches in EMBASE and MEDLINE. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies, with a total of 1406 IBD patients and 1060 controls were identified. The differences in alpha diversity varied across studies and were related to geography, whereas differences in beta diversity between cases and controls were found in a large majority of the studies. Overall, the results were inconsistent at different taxonomic levels, and the studied populations were heterogeneous, as were the methodological approaches. The most consistent finding was an increase of Candida for both CD and UC and of Malassezia in CD, where it was often linked to a decrease of Saccharomyces. CONCLUSIONS: The mycobiome is altered in IBD, as differences in beta diversity were found between cases and controls consistently. Future studies should carefully standardize every step from sample collection through analysis and data processing, allowing external validation of findings. Inclusion of treatment naïve patients and symptomatic controls could further advance this field.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,24/09/2025

However, viral diversity within wildlife remains insufficiently explored. This work performs an extensive analysis of 57 536 publicly high-throughput sequencing datasets from wild mammals and birds, resulting in the generation of ≈613.45 million assembled contigs, including 131 509 potential viral contigs identified through BLASTn and BLASTx searches. Following the exclusion of index hopping contamination, 9788 are categorized into 25 viral families with known zoonotic potential. These results indicate significant spatial and host-specific variability in viral distribution and reveal a positive correlation between viral diversity and host biodiversity. Rodents, bats, ungulates, and anseriformes exhibit the highest viral diversity. Notably, 50% of the viral sequences exhibit <90% amino acid identity to known viruses, indicating of potential novel viruses. Host-virus network uncovers 458 associations, 67.9% are unreported. Further, sequences of avian influenza viruses are identified in goats, while SARS-CoV-2 are detected in goats, ferrets, porpoises, cactus mice, and house finches. These findings highlight the largely uncharacterized viral diversity in wildlife, underscore the urgent requirement for surveillance at the wildlife-livestock interfaces.

Creeping fat (CF) is the wrapping of mesenteric adipose tissue around diseased bowel, of which the role in CD stricture progression is unclear.

We further showed that analogous Cthrc1+ mouse fibroblasts derive from mesenteric adipose tissue stromal cells, infiltrate fibrotic bowel, and deposit extracellular matrix in a YAP/TAZ-dependent manner in a mouse model of intestinal fibrosis.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included 345 informal caregivers of lecanemab-treated patients. We collected online questionnaires from 37 tertiary hospitals across 31 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities in China (2024/06/24 ∼ 2024/12/24). RESULTS: Approximately 94.5% of the caregivers opined that the burden of care did not intensify (including remaining constant or being alleviated) subsequent to the administration of lecanemab, among which 25.8% of the caregivers stated that the burden of care was mitigated. Those caregivers with a higher annual family income (≥¥400,000, p < 0.01) and filial caregivers exhibited greater confidence in the therapeutic efficacy of lecanemab. DISCUSSION: Most caregivers hold a positive attitude toward lecanemab, particularly filial caregivers. The application of lecanemab may alleviate the care burden on caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted the first China national survey on Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver decision-making and lecanemab experience, collecting 345 questionnaires. The majority of caregivers in China hold a favorable attitude toward lecanemab. Higher education, younger age, and filial relationships are associated with reduced caregiver burden. Higher income is linked to increased caregiver confidence and better lecanemab adherence. There is a low adoption rate of blood-based AD biomarkers in caregiver decisions.",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,01/09/2025

Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) are promising models, but larger prospective studies are needed to confirm their predictive value. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: mCRC patients underwent a metastatic biopsy for PDO establishment, before starting new systemic treatment. Predictors of PDO establishment were identified. PDOs were incubated with a seven-drug panel, including the patient's treatment, to determine drug sensitivity as measured by CyQUANT cell viability (AUC, GRAUC, IC50, and GR50). Patient response was measured by size change of biopsied and all target lesions. The diagnostic performance was evaluated by PPV, NPV, and AUROC. Additionally, the association between PDO response and survival was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 232 patients were included and 205 biopsies were obtained. PDO establishment success increased from 22% to 75%, yielding 52% overall. Male sex, increased lactate dehydrogenase, biopsy in academic hospitals, optimized culture conditions and experience were related to PDO establishment success. In this interim analysis, focused on oxaliplatin-based doublet chemotherapy, 42 PDOs were screened. PDO drug sensitivity significantly correlated with response of the biopsied lesion (R=0.41-0.49, p<0.011) and all target lesions (R=0.54-0.60, p<0.001) for all treatments combined. The 5-FU & oxaliplatin PDO screens demonstrated high predictive accuracy (PPV: 0.78, NPV: 0.80, AUROC: 0.78-0.88) and were associated with PFS and OS (p=0.016 and 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: We identified predictors for successful mCRC PDO establishment and validated that PDOs can accurately predict patient outcomes during systemic treatment, specifically with 5-FU & oxaliplatin.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,22/09/2025

Here we analyzed the spatial-temporal mortality patterns of the 1918 influenza pandemic in Spain, one of the countries of Europe that experienced the highest mortality burden. METHODS: We analyzed monthly death rates from respiratory diseases and all-causes across 49 provinces of Spain, including the Canary and Balearic Islands, during the period January-1915 to June-1919. We estimated the influenza-related excess death rates and risk of death relative to baseline mortality by pandemic wave and province. We then explored the association between pandemic excess mortality rates and health and socio-demographic factors, which included population size and age structure, population density, infant mortality rates, baseline death rates, and urbanization. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed high geographic heterogeneity in pandemic mortality impact. We identified 3 pandemic waves of varying timing and intensity covering the period from Jan-1918 to Jun-1919, with the highest pandemic-related excess mortality rates occurring during the months of October-November 1918 across all Spanish provinces. Cumulative excess mortality rates followed a south-north gradient after controlling for demographic factors, with the North experiencing highest excess mortality rates. A model that included latitude, population density, and the proportion of children living in provinces explained about 40% of the geographic variability in cumulative excess death rates during 1918-19, but different factors explained mortality variation in each wave. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial fraction of the variability in excess mortality rates across Spanish provinces remained unexplained, which suggests that other unidentified factors such as comorbidities, climate and background immunity may have affected the 1918-19 pandemic mortality rates. Further archeo-epidemiological research should concentrate on identifying settings with combined availability of local historical mortality records and information on the prevalence of underlying risk factors, or patient-level clinical data, to further clarify the drivers of 1918 pandemic influenza mortality.",BMC infectious diseases,05/07/2014

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1021 RC patients in three hospitals were divided into the training and test sets (n = 319), the internal validation set (n = 317), and external validation sets 1 (n = 158) and 2 (n = 227). Deep learning was performed to automatically segment the entire lesion on high-resolution MRI. Simple linear iterative clustering was used to divide each tumor into subregions, from which radiomics features were extracted. The optimal number of clusters reflecting the diversity of the tumor ecosystem was determined. Finally, four models were developed: clinical, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH)-based, radiomics, and fusion models. The performance of these models was evaluated. The impact of nCRT on disease-free survival (DFS) was further analyzed. RESULTS: The Delong test revealed the fusion model (AUCs of 0.867, 0.851, 0.852, and 0.818 in the four cohorts, respectively), the radiomics model (0.831, 0.694, 0.753, and 0.705, respectively), and the ITH model (0.790, 0.786, 0.759, and 0.722, respectively) were all superior to the clinical model (0.790, 0.605, 0.735, and 0.704, respectively). However, no significant differences were detected between the fusion and ITH models. Patients stratified using the fusion model showed significant differences in DFS between the good and poor response groups (all p < 0.05 in the four sets). CONCLUSION: The fusion model combining clinical factors, radiomics features, and ITH features may help predict pathologic response in RC cases receiving nCRT. KEY POINTS: Question Identifying rectal cancer (RC) patients likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) before treatment is crucial. Findings The fusion model shows the best performance in predicting response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Clinical relevance The fusion model integrates clinical characteristics, radiomics features, and intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH)features, which can be applied for the prediction of response to nCRT in RC patients, offering potential benefits in terms of personalized treatment strategies.",European radiology,22/09/2025
10.1186/s40035-025-00510-8,Targeting the glymphatic system: Aβ accumulation and phototherapy strategies across different stages of Alzheimer's disease.,"Zhao D, Wang J, Zhu Y, Zhang H, Ni C, Zhao Z, Dai J, He R, Liu G, Gan C, Zhang S, Tong Z","The glymphatic system serves as the brain's clearance system. It deteriorates with age and is a significant contributor to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Modulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based clearance and targeting key components of the glymphatic system, such as aquaporin-4, can enhance amyloid-beta (Aβ) clearance. Light therapy is emerging as a potential AD treatment approach, which involves the use of visible and near-infrared light at specific wavelengths (630/680/808/850/1070 nm), photosensitive proteins, and sensory stimulation at particular frequencies (e.g., 40 Hz). This phototherapy strategy can broadly influence the intracerebral fluid dynamics, including cerebral blood flow, CSF, and interstitial fluid (ISF), as well as structures related to the glymphatic system, such as vascular endothelial cells, glial cells, and neurons. Additionally, it may directly or indirectly inhibit Aβ accumulation by modulating endogenous small molecules, thereby improving cognitive function. Our previous research demonstrated that 630-nm red light can inhibit Aβ cross-linking by clearing endogenous formaldehyde and promoting ISF drainage. Notably, Aβ accumulation exhibits distinct characteristics at different phases of AD, accompanied by varying features of glymphatic system impairment. In the early stages, deep brain regions are significantly affected, whereas in the late stages, accumulation primarily occurs in the paracentral, precentral, and postcentral cortices. Owing to the limited penetration depth of light, this may pose a challenge to the clinical efficacy of phototherapy. Therefore, different stages of AD may require tailored phototherapeutic strategies. Meanwhile, it is important to acknowledge the ongoing controversies associated with lymphovenous anastomosis, a procedure that targets the glymphatic system. Therefore, this article reviews the characteristics of glymphatic system impairment across various AD stages and the mechanisms by which effective phototherapies modulate the glymphatic system. Potential phototherapeutic strategies corresponding to different stages of Aβ accumulation are also proposed.",Translational neurodegeneration,24/09/2025

The molecular characteristics of infiltrating GBM cells and their interactions with brain cells remain poorly understood, partly due to limited spatial tools for distinguishing tumor cells from those in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we introduce Spatially-resolved Chimeric AnalyzeR (SCAR), a computational tool for dissecting tumor-TME gene expression in spatial transcriptomics of human-mouse chimeric cancer models. SCAR reveals spatially distinct characteristics of GBM and their interactions with TME, identifying that infiltrative GBM up-regulates creatine kinase brain type (CKB) at the astrocyte-enriched leading edge compared to the tumor core. Mechanistically, GBM-secreted CKB catalyzes the extracellular conversion of astrocyte-supplied adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine into phosphocreatine, providing metabolic support for infiltrative tumor growth, which can be blocked by cyclocreatine. These results provide proof-of-concept validation of SCAR and demonstrate spatial context-dependent metabolic rewiring of GBM cells, with implications for therapies targeting infiltrative GBM.",Science advances,26/09/2025

T cell antigen receptor (TCR) sequencing revealed >70% of unique and >90% of total Mtb-specific TCR clonotypes in LTBI are linked to recognition of infected macrophages, while a subset required exogenous antigen exposure, suggesting incomplete recognition. Clonotypes specific for multiple Mtb antigens, and other pathogens, were identified. Remarkably, antigen screening revealed all TCRs to be specific for type VII secretion system (T7SS) substrates. Mtb-specific clonotypes expressed signature effector functions dominated by IFNγ, TNF, IL-2, and GM-CSF or chemokine production and signaling. We propose that TB vaccines, which elicit T cells specific for T7SS substrates, recognize infected macrophages, and express canonical effector functions, will offer protection against TB.",The Journal of experimental medicine,01/12/2025

METHODS: Eight machine learning models-Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, and Decision Tree-were constructed and rigorously evaluated. Model performance was assessed using the Brier score, calibration slope, F1 score, Youden index, the area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy (ACC). Decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves were employed to evaluate clinical utility, while Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots were used to enhance model interpretability. RESULTS: The study enrolled a total of 1595 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer, among whom 407 (25.52%) were diagnosed with VTE during the study period. The models were ranked based on several metrics, with GBM achieving the highest overall score of 44. A Brier score of 0.151, a calibration slope of 1.031, an F1 score of 0.827, a Youden index of 0.466, an AUC of 0.797, and an ACC of 0.757 were obtained. Key predictors included D-dimer and Lymphocyte Count (LYM). SHAP analysis provided valuable insights into the relative contribution of each predictor to the model's risk assessment. CONCLUSION: This study established a robust VTE risk prediction model using GBM, demonstrating high accuracy and clinical applicability for patients with esophageal cancer. The integration of advanced machine learning techniques into clinical practice highlights the potential to reduce VTE-related morbidity and mortality in high-risk patient populations.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",24/09/2025

Colorectal tumors, the third most diagnosed cancer globally, already show increased incidence in patients with metabolic disorders who typically require these medications. For example, obese subjects had significantly higher risk of colorectal tumor than healthy subjects. However, existing evidence on this association remains inconsistent. This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the comparative incidence of colorectal tumors associated with specific GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a confirmatory NMA focused specifically on colorectal tumor incidence as an adverse effect, following Cochrane methodological recommendations. We performed a frequentist-based NMA of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was colorectal tumor incidence, with safety profiles assessed by dropout rates as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: This NMA encompassing 68 RCTs with 207,200 participants found that only semaglutide was associated with increased incidence of colorectal tumors compared to controls. A dose-stratified analysis revealed that high-dose injectable semaglutide (2.4 mg/week) was the only regimen associated with increased incidence. Further, when focusing on RCTs of obese subjects, this increased colorectal tumor rate related to semaglutide still existed. Neither other GLP-1 receptor agonists nor any SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated significant associations with colorectal tumor development. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the first comprehensive NMA addressing incidence of colorectal tumor related to individual GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship to semaglutide, particularly in its high-dose injectable form (2.4 mg/week). These findings represent a potential risk signal that requires further validation given the already elevated baseline colorectal tumor risk in the target population, especially in subjects with obesity. Future research should focus on long-term follow-up studies to better characterize the mechanisms and clinical implications of this semaglutide-specific risk signal.","International journal of surgery (London, England)",24/09/2025

The release of granulocyte activation markers (GAM) into CSF has recently been shown to distinguish NMOSD from multiple sclerosis (MS) with high accuracy. However, their pathogenetic role in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is less clear, and their usefulness for diagnostic differentiation is unknown. This observational cohort study by eight tertiary centres in Europe and Japan included 244 CSF samples from patients with MOGAD (n=71), NMOSD (n=48), MS (n=125), and control persons (n=19). CSF levels of GAM (neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, NGAL, MMP-8, MMP-9), astrocyte damage markers (ADM: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B), and complement factors C5 and C5a were analysed by capillary ELISA (Ella™) or Luminex®. The primary outcome was the capacity of these markers to differentiate MOGAD, NMOSD, and MS in the acute (≤21 days post-exacerbation) stage, and the correlation of GAM with C5 and C5a. Secondary analyses included the correlations of these markers with disability severity, measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). GAM (except for MMP-9), ADM, and C5/C5a levels peaked at onset of disease exacerbation of MOGAD and NMOSD (regardless of aquaporin-4 antibody status), and were significantly higher than in MS. MMP-9 levels were continuously increased in MS over MOGAD and NMOSD, both in acute and subacute/chronic stages. C5 and C5a were equally increased over MS in acute stages of MOGAD and NMOSD. A logistic model and receiver operating characteristics analyses incorporating GAM and C5 displayed high discriminatory power between MOGAD/NMOSD vs MS (area under the curve (AUC) 0.880), NMOSD vs MS (AUC 0.837), and MOGAD vs MS (AUC 0.925) in acute stages. Accordingly, increased ADM levels in NMOSD differentiated NMOSD from MS and MOGAD (AUC 0.897 and 0.843, respectively). GAM levels correlated with EDSS scores in MOGAD and NMOSD, but not in MS, while those of ADM correlated with disability in NMOSD, but not in MOGAD and MS. Determining CSF levels of GAM and C5/C5a, and of ADM provide a biology-driven approach to differentiate MOGAD, NMOSD and MS. Their measurement can be processed faster and with similar accuracy than with most auto-antibody assays, enabling timely initiation of appropriate therapy in acute presentations. The correlation between GAM and C5/C5a levels with neurological impairment in MOGAD and NMOSD corroborates their role as effectors of neural damage, supporting the acute stage use of inhibitors of C5 activation.",Brain : a journal of neurology,24/09/2025

Most cases of HCC develop in the setting of chronic liver disease, particularly cirrhosis, where ongoing cycles of inflammation, hepatocyte death and regeneration foster the gradual accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that promote malignant transformation. These molecular changes contribute to the high degree of tumour heterogeneity observed in HCC, a major factor underlying resistance to current treatments. As a result, sustained clinical responses to existing therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors, remain uncommon. In this context, a growing body of evidence has identified epigenetic dysregulation as a key driver of tumour progression and therapeutic resistance, highlighting a new frontier for intervention. This review provides clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of epigenetic therapies in HCC, summarising results from both completed and ongoing clinical trials involving the so-called 'epidrugs'.

10.1016/j.metabol.2025.156394,Emerging roles of TRIM in metabolic regulation.,"Wang J, Wang Q, Li X, Cai Q, Bi Y, Xu C, Bai H, Gu L, Chang G, Chen S","Recent findings have broadened our understanding of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, positioning these proteins as pivotal regulators of cellular metabolism and cell fate. Primarily functioning as versatile E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM proteins orchestrate key metabolic pathways-including glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism-through both ubiquitination-dependent and -independent mechanisms such as oligomerization and epigenetic modification. For example, TRIM38, TRIM11, and TRIM24 have been reported to modulate glycolytic flux and insulin signaling by targeting key glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, with effects on cancer metabolism and insulin responses in model systems. Similarly, TRIM21 and TRIM56 have been implicated in fatty acid synthesis, oxidation, and cholesterol balance, with potential relevance to fatty-liver conditions and atherosclerosis. Moreover, TRIM-mediated regulation of amino acid metabolism-particularly through pathways involving glutamine and branched-chain amino acids-plays a central role in tumor metabolic reprogramming and survival. Beyond enzymatic regulation, TRIM proteins exert non-canonical functions through epigenetic modulation and interactions with signaling networks. This review synthesizes current insights into the multifaceted roles of TRIM proteins in metabolic control and cell death, suggesting that ferroptosis may link TRIM proteins to lipid and amino acid metabolism, and highlights the connection between TRIM proteins and metabolic stress as a key area for future research.",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,21/09/2025

Assembly and function of the system require at least 27 Dot and Icm proteins, yet its architecture and activation mechanism remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we deploy in situ single-particle cryoelectron microscopy to determine near-atomic structures of the Dot/Icm machine and its intimate association with three distinct outer membrane porins in intact bacteria. Notably, two essential yet enigmatic components, DotA and IcmX, form a pentameric protochannel in an inactive state at the central axis of the Dot/Icm machine. Upon Dot/Icm activation with host lysate, this protochannel undergoes extensive rearrangements to generate an extended transenvelope conduit, as visualized by cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging. Furthermore, a combination of cryo-ET and cryo-FIB milling of macrophages infected with L. pneumophila reveals tethering of the Dot/Icm machine to the host membrane, suggesting direct translocation of effector proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host. Together, our studies identify the DotA-IcmX complex as a gatekeeper for effector translocation and provide a molecular framework for understanding the assembly and activation of the elaborate Dot/Icm T4SS.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,30/09/2025
10.1111/ppe.12601,Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and childhood behavioural problems: Discrepancies between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes.,"Parker SE, Collett BR, Werler MM","BACKGROUND: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is common and has been associated with childhood behavioural problems among offspring, specifically hyperactivity and conduct problems. OBJECTIVE: Assessments of child behaviour in many previous studies have relied on maternal or parent report. Acknowledging that results of behavioural assessments vary between informants, we examined the association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and behaviour problems in childhood based on mother- and teacher-report. METHODS: A longitudinal study of 560 mother-child pairs with data on illnesses and medication use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental assessments during childhood was conducted. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was captured using a standardised maternal interview, completed 1 year after delivery on average. Measures of childhood (6-12 years of age) behaviour were obtained via mother- and teacher-report, using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Teacher Report Form. Linear and log-binomial models were used to calculate adjusted mean differences (MD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for internalising, externalising, and total behaviour problems comparing acetaminophen users to non-users. Stabilized inverse probability weights were used to account for loss to follow-up, and adjustments for indication were made. RESULTS: Approximately 60% (n = 354) of women reported use of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with an increase in total behaviour problem score and risk of clinical behaviour problems according to mother report (MD 2.2, 95% CI 0.3, 4.1 and RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.99, 3.76) but not according to teacher report. Weighting to account for participation did not alter results, while adjustment for indications of acetaminophen use greatly attenuated the associations with mother-reported total behaviour problem score and risk of clinical behaviour problems (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.1, 2.3 and RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.67, 2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was weakly associated with mother-reported behaviour problems and not associated with teacher-reported problems.",Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,01/05/2020

Our recent translational studies demonstrated that STE20-type kinases STK25 and MST3 associate with intracellular lipid droplets and play a pivotal role in regulating the dynamic balance between fat storage and utilization. This study aimed to assess the in vivo effects of the combined inhibition of STK25 and MST3 in obese mice. METHODS: We performed phenotypic characterization in three cohorts of mice fed a high-fat diet: (1) mice with genetic ablation of Stk25, (2) mice treated with Mst3-targeting antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), and (3) mice depleted of both STK25 and MST3 by injecting Stk25(-/-) mice with Mst3 ASO. Whole-body metabolic physiology and organ lipotoxicity were examined in the STK25- and/or MST3-deficient mice compared with their respective controls by using histological assessments, immunofluorescence microscopy, molecular profiling, and biochemical assays. RESULTS: We found that the inactivation of STK25 and MST3, either individually or in combination, provided equal protection against ectopic fat accumulation and associated lipotoxic damage in the liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle of obese mice. Strikingly, high-fat diet-fed STK25/MST3-deficient mice, but not mice lacking only one kinase, displayed reduced body and fat mass gain, which was accompanied by markedly increased abundance of thermogenesis markers in the brown adipose tissue (BAT). CONCLUSIONS: Dual inhibition of STK25 and MST3 in mice mitigates obesity-triggered lipotoxic injury to metabolic tissues and elevates indicators of BAT thermogenic capacity.",BMC medicine,22/09/2025

Baicalein, a bioactive flavonoid derived from Scutellaria baicalensis, has shown promising antitumor properties in preclinical studies, yet its precise molecular targets and mechanisms in BC remain inadequately characterized. This study integrates network pharmacology, molecular docking, transcriptomic profiling, and microbiomics to systematically elucidate the therapeutic potential and clinical relevance of baicalein in BC. We identified 37 baicalein-related targets (BRTs) through network pharmacology, narrowing these to four hub targets (HSP90AA1, CCNB1, NCOA2, TDRD7) via differential expression analysis and prognostic validation. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed strong binding affinities (≤ - 5.0 kJ/mol) between baicalein and these targets. A baicalein-related prognostic signature (BRPS) was constructed via multivariate Cox regression, stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. The high-risk group exhibited significantly worse overall survival (P < 0.001), elevated immunosuppression (e.g., M2 macrophage enrichment), and reduced chemotherapy sensitivity. Functional enrichment analyses revealed divergent pathways between the risk groups: the high-risk group was enriched in extracellular matrix remodeling and PI3K-AKT signaling, whereas the low-risk group presented activation of cytokine interactions and B-cell receptor pathways. Notably, intratumor microbiome (IM) profiling revealed 125 differentially abundant microbial taxa, with Succinimonas and Acidibacillus correlating positively with high-risk BRT expression. Immune landscape analysis further demonstrated that low-risk patients presented increased CD8 + T/NK cell infiltration, elevated immune checkpoint expression (PD-1/CTLA-4), and greater predicted responsiveness to immunotherapy. Drug sensitivity analysis linked the BRPS to chemotherapeutic efficacy, with high-risk patients showing susceptibility to methotrexate and docetaxel. This study accurately identified the four core targets of baicalein in treating BC. The BRPS could predict patient prognosis and guide personalized therapeutic strategies, positioning baicalein as a potential adjunct to conventional therapies. These findings bridge traditional pharmacology with systems biology, offering actionable insights for precision oncology in BC management.",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,22/09/2025

However, the optimal treatment strategies remained uncertainty due to limited high-quality evidence. RESEARCH QUESTION: In patients with RA-ILD, how does tocilizumab compare to rituximab in terms of prognosis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database to emulate a target trial of RA-ILD patients treated with either tocilizumab or rituximab. Propensity score matching was employed to balance disease severity between groups. Primary and secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, and medical utilizations risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Each matched cohort included 1,194 patients. Over 5 years, all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between tocilizumab and rituximab groups (HR: 1.073, 95% CI: 0.881-1.305). Secondary outcomes, including hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, were also comparable. Excluding patients with other Systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD)-related ILD yielded consistent results. In sensitivity analysis, RA-ILD patients with elevated baseline inflammatory markers experienced higher risks with tocilizumab in mechanical ventilation (HR: 1.936, 95% CI: 1.125-3.331), and all-cause mortality (HR: 1.403 95% CI: 1.013-1.942). Additionally, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)-naïve patients with high inflammatory markers had an increased risk of mechanical ventilation (HR: 1.539, 95% CI: 1.074-2.206).

DNA damage is a hallmark of ageing, particularly when occurring at telomeres, genomic regions vulnerable to oxidative damage and often challenging for the cell to repair. Here, we show that brains of 3xTg-AD mice, an established AD model characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced pathology, exhibit increased activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways at telomeres. Exposure of mouse primary hippocampal neurons to 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) oligomers, a significant pathogenetic contributor to AD, triggers telomeric DDR by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species caused by calcium imbalance. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting non-coding RNAs generated at damaged telomeres in vivo (in 3xTg-AD mice) and in vitro reduce neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived human cortical neurons and mouse primary neurons while inhibiting Aβ42-induced telomeric DDR, and restore transcriptional pathways altered by Aβ and found dysregulated in AD patients.

Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records(4,5). However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT(6) (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual's past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M's generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods(7) provide insights into Delphi-2M's predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.",Nature,17/09/2025

Several clinical trials have employed neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NIC) for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), resulting in significant benefits for many patients. However, response rates remain limited, underscoring the need for more effective screening methods and novel therapeutic strategies. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to play a crucial role in tumor progression and impact the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that TAMs exhibit phenotypic and functional heterogeneity. In this study, a distinct population of CCL5(hi) macrophages is identified that plays a critical role in ESCC when treated with immunochemotherapy. Furthermore, insights are gained into the underlying mechanisms, revealing the existence of a feedback loop involving IFN-γ, CCL5(hi) macrophages, and CD8(+) T cells within the tumor microenvironment of ESCC undergoing immunochemotherapy. Specific signatures associated with CCL5(hi) macrophages are correlated with a better response to immunochemotherapy in patients with ESCC. Moreover, the in vivo experiments demonstrate that CCL5 supplementation enhances the effectiveness of immunochemotherapy.

Using integrative multiomics, we longitudinally profiled at-risk individuals, where one-third of participants developed clinical RA on study. We found evidence of systemic inflammation and signatures of activation in naïve T and B cells of at-risk individuals. During progression to clinical RA, proinflammatory skewing of atypical B cells and expansion of memory CD4 T cells with signatures of activation and B cell help were present without elevations in circulating ACPA titers. Epigenetic changes in naïve CD4 T cells suggested a predisposition to differentiate into effector cells capable of B cell help.

We aimed to determine whether universal GDM screening using a single oral glucose intolerance test (OGTT) at 18-20 weeks' gestation improves pregnancy outcomes compared with standard screening at 24-28 weeks' gestation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a dual-center, parallel, randomized controlled trial with a planned interim analysis in singleton pregnant women to compare the effect of midpregnancy screening for GDM at 18-20 weeks' gestation and standard screening at 24-28 weeks' gestation. GDM was universally screened and diagnosed using 75-g OGTTs and the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria. The primary outcome was a composite measure of primary cesarean delivery, birth weight >90th percentile, neonatal hypoglycemia, cord serum C-peptide >90th percentile, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and birth trauma. RESULTS: The trial was stopped early for futility after the interim analysis. Of the 967 women included in the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary outcome was not significantly different between the two groups. Neonatal hypoglycemia was significantly lower and neonatal adiposity in women with GDM was higher in the midpregnancy screening group compared with the standard screening group. Adverse event rates were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Advancing universal GDM screening to midpregnancy at 18-20 weeks' gestation may not improve pregnancy outcomes, except for a reduction in neonatal hypoglycemia.

Such adoptive T cell therapies are effective in patients with certain haematological cancers but challenges persist, including primary and secondary resistance, a lack of efficacy in patients with solid tumours, a narrow range of targetable antigens, and time-consuming and complex manufacturing processes. CRISPR-based genome editing is a potent strategy to enhance cellular immunotherapies. Conventional CRISPR-Cas9 systems are useful for gene editing, transgene knock-in or gene knockout but can result in undesired editing outcomes, including translocations and chromosomal truncations. Base editing and prime editing technologies constitute a new generation of CRISPR platforms and enable highly precise and programmable installation of defined nucleotide variants in primary T cells. Owing to their high precision and versatility, base editing and prime editing systems, hereafter collectively referred to as CRISPR 2.0, are advancing to become the new standard for precision-engineering of cellular immunotherapies. CRISPR 2.0 can be used to augment immune cell function, broaden the spectrum of targetable antigens and facilitate streamlined production of T cell therapies.

This report presents the summary of the Global Myopia Public Health Summit jointly organized by the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB), the Asia Optometric Congress (AOC), and Aier Eye Hospital Group in September 2024. The summit centered on the public health, clinical challenges, and practical barriers faced in different regions of the world, along with strategic recommendations for myopia prevention and control. The summit has concluded: (1) although myopia prevalence is rising globally, population-based data remain limited in many regions; (2) common challenges such as limited awareness of myopia, the high cost of interventions, and the lack of continuing education for practitioners should be addressed; (3) while effective interventions are crucial for controlling myopia, their cost-effectiveness needs to be evaluated both at the individual and societal levels; (4) countries like China, where government-led initiatives have integrated school vision screening, reduction of education burden, compulsory increase of outdoor activities, and advocacy for eye health awareness, offer valuable experience and lessons for other countries or regions facing similar myopia epidemics.",Global health research and policy,23/09/2025

This comprehensive review examines the effects of four environmental stressors, including cold (cold therapy), heat (heat therapy), hot-cold alternation (contrast therapy) and reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia therapy), on muscle recovery following EIMD. The analysis of related randomised controlled trials assessed the influences of these stressors on five markers of recovery (muscular performance, joint amplitude, muscle pain, swelling and blood biomarkers). Although cold therapy has been widely studied, the lack of consensus on its application modalities leads to controversial debates regarding its effectiveness for muscle recovery. Heat therapy, particularly hot water immersion, appears to be the most effective method for restoring muscle function. However, the use of local heating techniques is less well understood. Moreover, contrast therapy seems to be promising for reducing swelling post-EIMD; however, the lack of studies and the variety of utilised techniques involving contrast therapy limit conclusions. Finally, local hypoxia, which is elicited by intermittent blood flow restriction, demonstrates potential for reducing inflammation and improving the recovery of muscle function, based on the appropriate application of protocols. By synthesising existing data, this comprehensive review shows that most environmental stress-based therapies can be effective, if the modalities of application-such as dose or frequency-are appropriate. It offers practical recommendations for optimising muscle recovery. This review also highlights the need for further research to refine protocols and better understand the potential synergistic effects of these environmental stress-based interventions.","Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",22/09/2025
10.1002/cnr2.70290,Early Markers of Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle Metabolic Derangement in the Apc(min/+) Male Mouse.,"Parry TL, Wood N, Garritson J, Muehlbauer MJ, Tichy L, Brantley JT, Bain JR, Hayward R","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cancer cachexia is a metabolic and wasting disease that occurs in up to 80% of cancer patients. Currently, there are no clear diagnostic criteria, its effects are irreversible, and it cannot be treated. Most patients progress undetected to late stages of cancer cachexia, stop responding to traditional treatment, and die without an effective intervention. While the literature has begun to characterize late (refractory) cachexia muscle metabolic changes, less is known about early changes that may precede obvious muscle dysfunction and wasting. Therefore, this investigation aimed to characterize early phase heart and skeletal muscle metabolic changes in a preclinical model of colorectal cancer. METHODS: The Apc(min/+) mouse spontaneously forms tumors along the intestinal tract and is a well-accepted preclinical colorectal cancer model. To identify early changes in muscle metabolism during colorectal cancer development, heart and gastrocnemius tissues from 15-week-old male Apc(min/+) and litter-matched non-carrier mice (wildtype) were analyzed by untargeted GC/MS metabolomics. RESULTS: In the heart, metabolic pathways related to taurine/hypotaurine metabolism; biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids; alanine, glutamate, and aspartate; arginine and proline; and arginine biosynthesis were affected by colorectal cancer. In skeletal muscle, metabolic pathways involving arginine biosynthesis; alanine, glutamate, aspartate, and proline metabolism were affected by cancer cachexia. Taken together, these data demonstrate altered arginine metabolism and proline metabolism in hearts and skeletal muscle of cachectic mice. Interestingly, cardiac muscle showed a non-preferential fuel switch towards less energetically favorable glycolysis (vs. fatty acid metabolism) that coincided with cardiac dysfunction, while skeletal muscle exhibited glucose dysregulation and possible insulin resistance. CONCLUSION: These data characterize early cardiac and skeletal muscle metabolic derangements that lead to muscle dysfunction and atrophy during colorectal cancer. Such data could help identify patients in early phases of cachexia or identification of cardiac and skeletal muscle specific therapeutic targets aimed at early intervention.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",01/09/2025

Using data from 73,411 participants, objectively quantifying physical activity through energy expenditure and time allocation, we identified longitudinal associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and neuropsychiatric diseases using Cox proportional hazards models. Our findings indicated that moderate to vigorous physical activity energy expenditure showed the strongest protective effect on neuropsychiatric diseases (hazard ratios: 0.60-0.86, all FDR-Q < 0.001), while an increased proportion of sedentary time was identified as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric diseases (HRs: 1.05-1.54, FDR-Q < 0.05). Restricted cubic spline analyses demonstrated an L-shaped association linking physical activity and neuropsychiatric diseases and an inverted L-shaped relationship between sedentary behavior and dementia. Linear regression models further linked physical activity and sedentary behavior to cognitive function, physical function, and mental health. Key brain regions related to these behaviors included the lateral occipital cortex, cuneus, pallidum, and accumbens. Proteomics and metabolic analyses identified significant involvement of ITGAV protein and high-intensity lipoprotein. Structural equation modeling elucidated that inflammation and metabolism mediate the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and neuropsychiatric diseases. Overall, our study provides critical evidence of the link between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and neuropsychiatric diseases, shedding light on potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying these associations.",Molecular psychiatry,20/09/2025
