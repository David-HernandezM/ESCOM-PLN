AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of socio-demographic factors and baseline health on the 
      mortality burden of seasonal and pandemic influenza remains debated. Here we 
      analyzed the spatial-temporal mortality patterns of the 1918 influenza pandemic 
      in Spain, one of the countries of Europe that experienced the highest mortality 
      burden. METHODS: We analyzed monthly death rates from respiratory diseases and 
      all-causes across 49 provinces of Spain, including the Canary and Balearic 
      Islands, during the period January-1915 to June-1919. We estimated the 
      influenza-related excess death rates and risk of death relative to baseline 
      mortality by pandemic wave and province. We then explored the association between 
      pandemic excess mortality rates and health and socio-demographic factors, which 
      included population size and age structure, population density, infant mortality 
      rates, baseline death rates, and urbanization. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed 
      high geographic heterogeneity in pandemic mortality impact. We identified 3 
      pandemic waves of varying timing and intensity covering the period from Jan-1918 
      to Jun-1919, with the highest pandemic-related excess mortality rates occurring 
      during the months of October-November 1918 across all Spanish provinces. 
      Cumulative excess mortality rates followed a south-north gradient after 
      controlling for demographic factors, with the North experiencing highest excess 
      mortality rates. A model that included latitude, population density, and the 
      proportion of children living in provinces explained about 40% of the geographic 
      variability in cumulative excess death rates during 1918-19, but different 
      factors explained mortality variation in each wave. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial 
      fraction of the variability in excess mortality rates across Spanish provinces 
      remained unexplained, which suggests that other unidentified factors such as 
      comorbidities, climate and background immunity may have affected the 1918-19 
      pandemic mortality rates. Further archeo-epidemiological research should 
      concentrate on identifying settings with combined availability of local 
      historical mortality records and information on the prevalence of underlying risk 
      factors, or patient-level clinical data, to further clarify the drivers of 1918 
      pandemic influenza mortality.
