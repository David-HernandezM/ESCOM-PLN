TI  - Bacillus Calmette-Guerin induces CD8+ T cell infiltration and suppresses tumor 
      progression in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer by downregulating ARID1A.

AB  - Neoadjuvant immunotherapy demonstrates limited efficacy in microsatellite-stable 
      (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC). In vivo observations reveal that Bacillus 
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG) can inhibit the progression of MSS-CRC and downregulate 
      ARID1A in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Through the analysis of clinical 
      samples, in vivo and in vitro models, and bioinformatics, we found that the low 
      expression of ARID1A promotes tumor growth in vitro; however, in vivo, it 
      enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration in MSS-CRC tissues while inhibiting tumor 
      growth. Further investigation revealed that BCG downregulates ARID1A via the 
      TLR4/NF-κB pathway, leading to the downregulation of MLH1 and PMS2 and subsequent 
      alterations in MMR function in MSS-CRC. This cascade enhances antigen 
      presentation, promotes CD8+ T cell infiltration, and contributes to tumor 
      suppression.
