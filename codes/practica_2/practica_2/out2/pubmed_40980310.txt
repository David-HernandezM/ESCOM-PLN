AB  - Obesity affects over 1 billion people worldwide and is linked to more than 230 
      health complications, with cardiovascular disease being a leading cause of 
      mortality. Losing 5%-10% of body weight is considered clinically significant for 
      improving health. This weight loss can be achieved through pharmacotherapy, 
      including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, 
      GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide dual receptor agonists, and 
      GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide/glucagon triple receptor agonists 
      (such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide, respectively). While much of 
      the weight loss comes from fat mass, these treatments also result in the loss of 
      lean mass, including muscle. This loss of muscle may contribute to difficulties 
      in maintaining weight over the long term and can lead to sarcopenia. Therefore, 
      the focus of new anti-obesity treatments should be primarily on reducing fat mass 
      while minimizing the loss of muscle mass, ideally promoting muscle gain. Research 
      focusing on human myocytes has identified more than 600 myokines associated with 
      muscle contraction, which may play a crucial role in preserving both muscle mass 
      and function. We explored the potential of new anti-obesity agents and their 
      combinations with incretin-based therapies to achieve these outcomes. Further 
      studies are needed to better understand the functional implications of lean mass 
      expansion during weight loss and weight maintenance programs.
