TI  - The Plasmodium CSP repeats have elastic properties with a critical role in 
      sporozoite motility.

AB  - The Plasmodium circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is the major surface protein of the 
      sporozoite, the infective stage of the malaria parasite. The central repeat 
      region of CSP is the primary immunological target of the sporozoite stage, yet 
      little is known about its structure or function. Here, we show that sporozoite 
      mutants with truncated or scrambled CSP repeats exhibit impaired motility due to 
      altered adhesion site formation and dynamics. Since CSP forms the environment in 
      which the thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP)-containing adhesion 
      sites assemble, our data suggest that the dense CSP coat is altered in the repeat 
      mutants, affecting adhesion site formation. We hypothesized that this role 
      depends on the biophysical properties of the repeats, and used single-molecule 
      fluorescence-force spectroscopy to test this hypothesis. Our results indicate 
      that the CSP repeats behave like a stiff, linear spring with elastic properties 
      that depend on its length and are lost when the repeats are scrambled. These data 
      provide evidence for a functional role of the CSP repeat region during Plasmodium 
      infection and motility.
