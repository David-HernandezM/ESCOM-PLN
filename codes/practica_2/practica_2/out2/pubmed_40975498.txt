AB  - DNA methylation represents a crucial epigenetic mechanism orchestrating gene 
      expression, cellular homeostasis, and the aging trajectory. Dysregulation of DNA 
      methyltransferases (DNMTs)-the enzymes catalyzing this process-has been 
      implicated in a wide spectrum of chronic conditions, including cancer, 
      cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging 
      evidence suggests that food-derived bioactive compounds can act as DNMT 
      inhibitors, reshaping epigenetic landscapes. This systematic review, registered 
      in PROSPERO (CRD42022320316), critically evaluated in vitro, in vivo animal, and 
      ex vivo studies investigating the effects of dietary bioactives on DNMT 
      expression and activity. A thorough search of PubMed up to May 23, 2025, yielded 
      103 studies, of which 76 met the inclusion criteria. Eligible publications were 
      original, peer-reviewed, and provided evidence from in vitro, in vivo animal, or 
      ex vivo models. Frequent candidates included epigallocatechin-3-gallate, 
      curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and folate. Notably, nearly 90% 
      of studies reported DNMT inhibition-often dose- and time-dependent. Approximately 
      21% defined minimal effective concentrations, predominantly for isolated 
      compounds. Several studies described synergistic interactions between bioactives, 
      and emerging data highlighted the gut microbiota's mediating role in epigenetic 
      modulation. Despite promising outcomes, the predominance of preclinical evidence 
      and variability in experimental protocols and dosing limit immediate 
      translational impact. Nonetheless, current findings underscore the promise of 
      dietary DNMT modulators as foundational elements for precision nutrition 
      strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-associated disease 
      risk. The potential application of DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) as a biomarker 
      of biological aging has been increasingly supported by recent literature, 
      reinforcing its relevance in future nutritional epigenetics research. Further 
      well-designed clinical trials are warranted to assess long-term efficacy, safety, 
      and bioavailability of these compounds, and to validate their use in personalized 
      epigenetic interventions, using biological aging markers. This review was funded 
      by the European Union-Next Generation EU, PNRR Project Age-It (DM 1557 
      11.10.2022), and the University of Padua SID Grant (2024DCTV1SIDPROGETTI-00194).
