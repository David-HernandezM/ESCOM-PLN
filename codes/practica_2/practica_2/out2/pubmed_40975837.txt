      and older adults: a population-based cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research indicates that constipation may be an early symptom 
      of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it remains uncertain whether constipation 
      is a unique symptom prior to PD or to other major neurological disorders as well. 
      This study aimed to explore the association between premorbid constipation and 
      three major neurological disorders: stroke, dementia and PD. METHODS: We 
      conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from UK Biobank. Constipation 
      was defined based on diagnosed cases in electronic health records, self-reported 
      instances or regular laxative use. The primary outcome was defined as the first 
      onset of any of three neurological disorders: stroke, dementia and PD. Cox 
      regression was used to adjust for socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle 
      factors, medical conditions and regular medication use. RESULTS: Out of 462,327 
      eligible participants, those with constipation were associated with higher 
      incidence of three outcome diseases (1415/20,263 [7.0%]) than those without 
      (18,848/442,064 [4.3%]), with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) being 1.35 [1.27-1.42]. 
      Specifically, those with constipation had a 20%, 50% and 56% higher risk of 
      stroke, dementia and PD, respectively. Both self-reported and diagnosed 
      constipation were associated with a higher risk of these conditions, with HR 
      being 1.31 (1.23-1.40) and 1.44 (1.30-1.59), respectively. Interestingly, the 
      association between constipation and neurological disorders was stronger within 
      the first 2 years from baseline. DISCUSSION: These findings support the 
      biological link between constipation and neurological disorders. Given its 
      potential role as a prodromal symptom for these diseases, both diagnosed and 
      self-reported constipation should be considered in risk prediction models.
