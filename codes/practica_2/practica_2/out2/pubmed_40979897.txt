TI  - Association Between Body Roundness Index and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary 
      Disease in US Adults: Data from NHANES 2013-2018.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between the body roundness index (BRI) and the 
      prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in US adults remains 
      unclear. This study aims to investigate the association between BRI and the 
      likelihood of developing COPD. METHODS: This study was conducted based on data 
      from the 2013-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants 
      were classified as having COPD if they met any of the following criteria: (i) 
      self-reported physician diagnosis of COPD; (ii) physician-confirmed diagnosis of 
      emphysema; or (iii) physician-confirmed diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. Those 
      who responded "no" to all of the above were categorized as non-COPD. To assess 
      the association between BRI and COPD, weighted logistic regression models, 
      subgroup analyses, and interaction tests were employed. The dose-response 
      relationship was investigated using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model. 
      RESULTS: A total of 14,254 individuals were included. The overall weighted 
      prevalence of COPD was 8.3%. After adjusting for multiple confounders, continuous 
      BRI was found to be positively associated with COPD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.140, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.033-1.259, P = 0.012). The RCS analysis confirmed a 
      linear dose-response relationship between BRI and COPD. Subgroup analyses 
      demonstrated substantial heterogeneity across sex, hypertension, and 
      cardiovascular disease subgroups, indicating that the association between BRI and 
      COPD may be impacted by these factors. CONCLUSION: Higher BRI levels were 
      positively associated with an increased likelihood of developing COPD among US 
      adults. Our study suggests that BRI holds promise as a tool for assessing the 
      odds of having COPD.
