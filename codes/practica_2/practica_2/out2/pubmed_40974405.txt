AB  - BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common human prion 
      disease, with genetic forms linked to PRNP gene mutations accounting for 10-15% 
      of cases. We present a case of probable genetic prion disease associated with a 
      novel PRNP mutation. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 60-year-old woman 
      developed gait ataxia and micrographia. Six months later, she experienced severe 
      anxiety, emotional lability, and visual hallucinations. Brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) showed cortical ribboning in the frontal-insular regions. Her 
      condition progressed to walking dependence and cerebellar dysarthria. She died 
      15 months after symptom onset. CSF analysis revealed elevated total-Tau 
      (1933 pg/mL; reference < 450 pg/mL). RT-QuIC assay using full-length recombinant 
      PrP was negative. Genetic testing revealed a Met/Val polymorphism at codon 129 
      and a novel heterozygous A118V mutation in the PRNP gene. A second RT-QuIC using 
      truncated PrP confirmed abnormal prion seeds, supporting a probable diagnosis of 
      prion disease. CONCLUSIONS: The compound heterozygous A118V and M129V PRNP 
      variant had not previously been associated with prion disease. Family history was 
      unobtainable, as relatives declined testing. The patient's 
      presentation-cerebellar and psychiatric symptoms-resembled 
      Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, though a definitive diagnosis was not 
      possible without neuropathology. MRI and RT-QuIC findings supported prion 
      disease. The positive result with truncated PrP highlights its diagnostic value, 
      offering improved sensitivity. This case underscores the phenotypic diversity of 
      PRNP mutations and the importance of molecular testing, especially when family 
      history or neuropathology is unavailable. PRNP gene analysis should be considered 
      in patients with rapidly progressive motor and cognitive symptoms suggestive of 
      prion disease.
