AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the impact of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) 
      inhibitors and metformin on the risk of glaucoma-related outcomes in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). DESIGN: Multinational, retrospective 
      clinical cohort study using patient data from 160 healthcare organizations across 
      21 countries. SUBJECTS: Adults with T2DM who initiated SGLT2 inhibitors or 
      metformin during 2013-2023 were included. INTERVENTION: Patients with T2DM 
      prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors were compared to those prescribed metformin. We 
      performed 1:1 propensity score matching to balance age, sex, race, glycated 
      hemoglobin, body mass index, medications, and comorbidities between the SGLT2 
      inhibitor and metformin groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The occurrence of ocular 
      hypertension, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and the need for glaucoma 
      medications. RESULTS: Our final analysis included 32,634 patients prescribed 
      SGLT2 inhibitors and 32,634 prescribed metformin. Compared to metformin, SGLT2 
      inhibitors are associated with significantly lower risks of ocular hypertension 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.89), POAG (HR, 
      0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81), and the need for glaucoma medications (HR, 0.76; 95% 
      CI, 0.69-0.84) in 5 years. These associations remain consistent in patients aged 
      ≥60 years, females, males, Whites, and those prescribed empagliflozin. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with T2DM, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors may be 
      associated with lower risks of ocular hypertension, POAG, and the need for 
      glaucoma medications compared to metformin.
