AB  - According to the Regulation (EC) N. 141/2000 of the European Parliament and of 
      the Council, rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
      conditions, affecting no more than 5 in 10 000 persons in the European Community. 
      It is estimated that between 6000 to 8000 distinct rare diseases affect up to 6% 
      of the total EU population. Therefore, these conditions can be considered rare if 
      taken individually but they affect a significant proportion of the European 
      population when considered as a single group. Several initiatives have been 
      undertaken at international, European and national level to tackle public health 
      as well as research issues related to the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and 
      surveillance of these diseases. The development of innovative and effective 
      medical products for their diagnosis and treatment is frequently hampered by 
      several factors, including the limited knowledge of their natural history, the 
      difficulties in setting up clinical studies due to the limited numbers of 
      patients affected by a specific disease, the weak interest of sponsors due to the 
      restricted market opportunities. Therefore, incentives and other facilitations 
      have been adopted in many parts of the world, including in the EU, in order to 
      facilitate the development and commercialization of diagnostic tools and 
      treatments devoted to rare diseases. This paper illustrates mainly the European 
      initiatives and will discuss the problematic and controversial aspects 
      surrounding orphan drugs. Finally, activities and measures adopted in Italy are 
      presented.
