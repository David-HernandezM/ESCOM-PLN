AB  - Adult mammalian hearts are non-regenerative, and a majority of studies examining 
      repair and potential regeneration post-myocardial infarction (MI) have focused on 
      cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation and infarcted zones. Here, we observed 
      aberrantly high expression of lysozyme 2 (Lyz2) in injured mouse hearts at both 
      local injury sites and at remote zones, with sustained Lyz2 expression 
      conspicuous in endocardial cells of non-regenerative hearts. Although 
      traditionally conceptualized as a myeloid marker, we demonstrate that LYZ2 
      functions as an injury-specific, positive regulator of lysosomal degradation 
      capacity that mediates pathogenic degradation of the extracellular matrix. We 
      observed an anti-apoptotic benefit to CMs upon disrupting LYZ2/LYZ function in 
      mice and in a human endomyocardium experimental model. Harnessing these insights, 
      we show that both Lyz2 knockout (KO) and pharmacological inhibition of lysosomal 
      degradation confer rapid functional recovery in injured non-regenerative hearts. 
      Thus, targeting a remote injury response in a non-CM cell type rapidly promotes 
      post-MI recovery of non-regenerative hearts.
