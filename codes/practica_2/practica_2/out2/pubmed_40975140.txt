AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced cough is a prevalent adverse drug reaction; however, the 
      risk of cough associated with various drug classes in real-world settings has not 
      been thoroughly elucidated. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to systematically 
      identify drug risk signals that are significantly associated with cough through 
      the FAERS database, covering data from the first quarter of 2004 to the fourth 
      quarter of 2024. The findings will provide evidence-based support for clinical 
      medication safety and individualized monitoring. METHODS: We extracted reports in 
      which cough was identified as the primary adverse event (AE) from the FAERS 
      database. After data cleaning to exclude duplicate and non-drug-related records, 
      use the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) for 
      disproportionality analysis. Standardize the Preferred Term (PT) for cough using 
      MedDRA 27.1. Additionally, classify each drug using the World Health 
      Organization's Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. 
      RESULTS: This study identified 1,951 drugs associated with the AE of "cough," 
      affecting a total of 247,158 patients. The drug categories most commonly linked 
      to cough included antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, respiratory system 
      medications, and cardiovascular system medications. The drugs (primary suspect) 
      with the highest number of reported cough cases were adalimumab, etanercept, and 
      sacubitril/valsartan. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to systematically 
      reveal the strength of association and baseline characteristics between multiple 
      categories of drugs and the risk of cough, confirming the high efficiency and 
      sensitivity of the FAERS database in pharmacovigilance. The findings of this 
      study provide an important basis for drug risk assessment and clinical 
      intervention.
