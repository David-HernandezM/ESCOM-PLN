AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) 
      confers an increased risk of mortality among patients with RA. However, the 
      optimal treatment strategies remained uncertainty due to limited high-quality 
      evidence. RESEARCH QUESTION: In patients with RA-ILD, how does tocilizumab 
      compare to rituximab in terms of prognosis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the 
      TriNetX US Collaborative Network database to emulate a target trial of RA-ILD 
      patients treated with either tocilizumab or rituximab. Propensity score matching 
      was employed to balance disease severity between groups. Primary and secondary 
      outcomes included all-cause mortality, and medical utilizations risk. Hazard 
      ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox regression. Subgroup and sensitivity 
      analyses were performed. RESULTS: Each matched cohort included 1,194 patients. 
      Over 5 years, all-cause mortality did not differ significantly between 
      tocilizumab and rituximab groups (HR: 1.073, 95% CI: 0.881-1.305). Secondary 
      outcomes, including hospitalization and mechanical ventilation, were also 
      comparable. Excluding patients with other Systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease 
      (SARD)-related ILD yielded consistent results. In sensitivity analysis, RA-ILD 
      patients with elevated baseline inflammatory markers experienced higher risks 
      with tocilizumab in mechanical ventilation (HR: 1.936, 95% CI: 1.125-3.331), and 
      all-cause mortality (HR: 1.403 95% CI: 1.013-1.942). Additionally, tumor necrosis 
      factor inhibitors (TNFi)-naïve patients with high inflammatory markers had an 
      increased risk of mechanical ventilation (HR: 1.539, 95% CI: 1.074-2.206). 
      INTERPRETATION: In this real-world cohort, tocilizumab and rituximab demonstrated 
      comparable effectiveness and safety in RA-ILD. However, among patients with 
      elevated baseline inflammatory markers, rituximab might be a safer choice than 
      tocilizumab.
