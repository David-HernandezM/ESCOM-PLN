TI  - A Randomized Trial of Shunting for Idiopathic Normal-Pressure Hydrocephalus.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2503109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus is a neurologic disorder 
      characterized by impaired gait, balance, cognition, and bladder control in older 
      adults. The disorder is treated with shunt surgery, but the effectiveness of 
      shunting is unclear. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled trial involving participants selected for shunt surgery on the 
      basis of gait-velocity improvement with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to an open-shunt valve setting (opening 
      pressure, 110 mm of water) or a placebo valve setting (opening pressure, >400 mm 
      of water) of a noninvasively adjustable shunt. The primary outcome was the change 
      in gait velocity 3 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes were the change at 3 
      months in the Tinetti scale total score (range, 0 to 28; lower scores indicate 
      worse gait and balance), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score (range, 0 to 
      30; lower scores indicate worse cognition), and Overactive Bladder Questionnaire 
      score (range, 0 to 100; higher scores indicate worse urinary incontinence). 
      RESULTS: A total of 99 participants underwent randomization and received the 
      assigned intervention. At 3 months, gait velocity had increased in the open-shunt 
      group (mean [±SD] change, 0.23±0.23 m per second; assessed in 49 participants) 
      and was unchanged in the placebo group (mean change, 0.03±0.23 m per second; 
      assessed in 49 participants), resulting in a treatment difference of 0.21 m per 
      second (95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.31; P<0.001). A significantly greater 
      improvement in the open-shunt group than the placebo group was seen for the 
      Tinetti scale score (mean change, 2.9 points vs. 0.5 points; P = 0.003) but not 
      the MoCA score (1.3 points vs. 0.3 points) or the Overactive Bladder 
      Questionnaire score (-3.3 points vs. -1.5 points). The results regarding adverse 
      events were mixed, with more participants in the placebo group reporting falls 
      (46% vs. 24%), an equal percentage having cerebral bleeding (2% in both groups), 
      and more participants in the open-shunt group having subdural bleeding (12% vs. 
      2%) and positional headaches (59% vs. 28%). CONCLUSIONS: Among participants with 
      idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus who had a response to temporary CSF 
      drainage, shunting resulted in significant improvements at 3 months in gait 
      velocity and a measure of gait and balance but not in measures of cognition or 
      incontinence. (Funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
