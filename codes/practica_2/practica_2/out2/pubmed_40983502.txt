AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining chemotherapy with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 
      (PD-1) improves clinical outcomes in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), 
      yet the underlying synergistic mechanism remains obscured. Moreover, 30-50% of 
      patients still derive no therapeutic benefit from the combination strategy, 
      highlighting the need to decipher and overcome resistance. OBJECTIVE: We sought 
      to investigate the mechanisms by which chemotherapy augments the responses to 
      immune checkpoint blockade and elucidate the factors contributing to persistent 
      resistance in non-responding patients. DESIGN: We designed a systematic 
      investigation involving longitudinal sampling of ESCC tissues both from patients 
      treated with chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The tumour 
      microenvironment (TME) was then comprehensively characterised using single-cell 
      transcriptomics, T cell receptor repertoire analysis, multiplex 
      immunohistochemistry and murine models. RESULTS: We demonstrated that combination 
      therapy exerted superior antitumour efficacy by mitigating immune checkpoint 
      engagements (TIGIT-NECTIN2 and NECTIN1-CD96) between epithelial-stress tumour 
      cells and CD8(+) T cells, thereby preventing T cells from exhaustion and boosting 
      vitality. In non-responders, we identified a subset of tumour cells with high 
      SLC1A3 expression, which localised at the tumour boundary and interacted with 
      COL1A1(+) myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts, inducing an 
      extracellular matrix-enriched TME that hindered the infiltration of CD8(+) T 
      cells. Inhibiting SLC1A3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy plus 
      anti-PD-1, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. CONCLUSION: This 
      study elucidates the synergistic mechanisms and identifies key resistance 
      pathways underlying chemo-immunotherapy combinations in patients with ESCC, 
      providing a scientific basis for refining future combination therapeutic 
      regimens.
