AB  - PURPOSE: As a crucial environmental factor, outdoor daylight exposure has become 
      an increasing focus in ophthalmic research. Although exploratory studies have 
      indicated a potential connection between daylight exposure and primary open-angle 
      glaucoma (POAG), a detailed association remains largely unknown. This study aimed 
      to examine the association using data from the UK Biobank. DESIGN: Combined 
      cross-sectional and cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Following the application of 
      exclusion criteria, 67,558 and 71,480 participants were included in the analysis 
      of POAG incidence and prevalence, respectively. Additionally, 69,441 and 28,029 
      participants were included in the analysis of intraocular pressure (IOP) and 
      ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness, which are traits related to POAG. METHODS: 
      The initial assessment of outdoor daylight exposure duration was conducted using 
      a standardized touchscreen questionnaire and measured in hours per day. Cox 
      proportional hazard models were employed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) for each additional hour of exposure per day. 
      Additionally, logistic regression models and linear regression models were 
      utilized to investigate the association with POAG prevalence and POAG-related 
      traits, with adjustments made for multiple covariates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      POAG incidence, prevalence, and related traits. RESULTS: After adjusting for all 
      covariates, annual average daylight exposure duration (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 
      1.02-1.18; P = 0.009) and summer daylight exposure duration (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 
      1.02-1.14; P = 0.009) were associated with an increased incidence of POAG, and 
      stronger associations were observed for males. Participants with elevated outdoor 
      exposure duration had higher IOP levels across annual exposure (β, 0.04, 95% CI, 
      0.03-0.06, P<0.001), summer exposure (β, 0.04, 95% CI, 0.03-0.05, P<0.001), and 
      winter exposure (β = 0.02, 95% CI, 0.01-0.04, P=0.007). No association was found 
      between outdoor daylight exposure and the prevalence of POAG or GCC thickness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged daylight exposure, particularly during the summer, is 
      associated with an elevated risk of POAG incidence, possibly due to increased 
      IOP. These findings highlight the need for protective strategies against 
      excessive daylight exposure.
