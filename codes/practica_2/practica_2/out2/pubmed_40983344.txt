      the treatment of NSCLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major non-tumor cellular 
      components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and are closely related to immune 
      suppression. The enhancement of anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) 
      efficacy by antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors (TKIs) is partly 
      due to the elimination of CAFs, which improves the immunosuppressive 
      microenvironment. However, it remains unclear whether antiangiogenic TKIs 
      regulate the autophagy of CAFs, thereby affecting the immunotherapy response. 
      METHODS: We first examined the effects of autophagy inhibition and anlotinib on 
      the TME and immunotherapy response via animal experiments. Then, CAF models were 
      established in vitro. The effects and mechanisms of autophagy inhibition on the 
      efficacy of anlotinib and CAFs were further explored in vitro. To specifically 
      validate the role of CAF autophagy, we additionally constructed LLC tumor-bearing 
      mouse models co-implanted with CAFs transfected with ATG5-targeting siRNA or 
      non-targeting control siRNA. RESULTS: In anti-PD-1-resistant (LLC) and CAF-rich 
      (LA795+MSC) non-small cell lung cancer models, the autophagy inhibitor 
      chloroquine significantly enhanced anlotinib+anti-PD-1 efficacy-likely by 
      inducing more apoptosis of CAFs and M2 macrophages, reshaping the TME to promote 
      CD8+T cell infiltration. After ATG5 knockdown (autophagy inhibition) in CAFs, the 
      efficacy-enhancing effect of anti-PD-1 therapy was significantly attenuated 
      versus control, confirming CAF autophagy is core to TME regulation. In vitro, 
      anlotinib induced CAF autophagy via AKT/mTOR inhibition; inhibiting CAF autophagy 
      enhanced anlotinib-induced CAF apoptosis and impaired CAFs' ability to recruit M2 
      macrophages. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy inhibition enhances the effects of 
      antiangiogenic TKIs on tumor cells and CAFs and directly or indirectly regulates 
      the TME, which might explain why autophagy inhibition enhances the efficacy of 
      antiangiogenic TKIs combined with anti-PD-1 therapy.
