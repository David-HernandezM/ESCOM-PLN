AB  - Microglia, the principal immune cells of the central nervous system, have emerged 
      as important players in sensing and regulating neuronal activity. While 
      microglial activation is a hallmark in neurodegeneration, the specific role of 
      microglia in disease-related cortical excitability remains unknown. Utilizing 
      multichannel probe recordings and longitudinal in vivo calcium imaging, we 
      observed neuronal hyperactivity at the initial stage of disease progression in a 
      mouse model of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) neurodegeneration (rNLS8, 
      regulated nuclear localization sequence-deleted human TDP-43 transgenic mouse 
      model). Spatial and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a specific subpopulation 
      of microglia, rod-shaped microglia, with a distinct morphology and direct 
      response to cortical hyperactivity. Rod-shaped microglia predominantly interacted 
      with neuronal dendrites and remodeled excitatory synaptic inputs to attenuate 
      motor cortical hyperactivity. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 
      (TREM2) deficiency led to a marked reduction of rod-shaped microglia accompanied 
      by increased neuronal activity in rNLS8 mice. Together, our results suggest that 
      rod-shaped microglia play a neuroprotective role by attenuating cortical 
      hyperexcitability in TDP-43-related neurodegeneration.
