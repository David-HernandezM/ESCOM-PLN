TI  - Clesrovimab for Prevention of RSV Disease in Healthy Infants.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2502984 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clesrovimab is a long-acting investigational monoclonal antibody 
      against site IV of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein. Data 
      regarding the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab in healthy infants are needed. 
      METHODS: We randomly assigned healthy preterm and full-term infants entering 
      their first RSV season in a 2:1 ratio to receive one intramuscular 105-mg dose of 
      clesrovimab or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was RSV-associated 
      medically attended lower respiratory infection (including at least one indicator 
      of lower respiratory infection or disease severity) through 150 days after 
      injection. A key secondary efficacy end point was RSV-associated hospitalization 
      during the same period. RESULTS: A total of 3614 infants received an injection: 
      2412 infants received clesrovimab, and 1202 infants received placebo. Through day 
      150 after injection, RSV-associated medically attended lower respiratory 
      infection occurred in 60 of 2398 infants in the clesrovimab group (incidence rate 
      over 5-month period, 2.6%) and in 74 of 1201 infants in the placebo group 
      (incidence rate over 5-month period, 6.5%), for an efficacy of 60.4% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 44.1 to 71.9; P<0.001). RSV-associated hospitalization 
      within 150 days was reported in 9 of 2398 infants in the clesrovimab group and in 
      28 of 1201 infants in the placebo group, for an efficacy of 84.2% (95% CI, 66.6 
      to 92.6; P<0.001). Serious adverse events were reported in 278 of 2409 infants 
      (11.5%) in the clesrovimab group and 149 of 1202 infants (12.4%) in the placebo 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy preterm and full-term infants, a single dose of 
      clesrovimab reduced the incidence of RSV-associated medically attended lower 
      respiratory infection and RSV-associated hospitalization, with a safety profile 
      similar to that of placebo. (Funded by Merck Sharp and Dohme; CLEVER
