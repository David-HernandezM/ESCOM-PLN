AB  - This study elucidates the pathogenic role of environmental volatile organic 
      compounds (VOCs) in respiratory tumorigenesis, focusing on head and neck cancer 
      (HNSC), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). As 
      pervasive pollutants derived from industrial emissions, traffic exhaust, and 
      indoor contaminants, VOCs threaten public health, yet their molecular mechanisms 
      in multi-cancer pathogenesis remain poorly defined. By integrating network 
      toxicology and molecular docking, we systematically dissected VOC-driven 
      disruptions in respiratory homeostasis. Disease-associated targets were mined 
      from TCGA, CTD, and GeneCards databases, followed by core target identification 
      via STRING network analysis and Cytoscape. Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG) and 
      survival analyses revealed critical pathways, while molecular docking and 
      molecular dynamics validated pollutant-target interactions. Our results 
      demonstrate that VOCs directly perturb key targets (FN1, PECAM1, CDK1 etc.), 
      hijacking PI3K-Akt signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and cell cycle 
      regulation to promote apoptosis evasion and unchecked proliferation. 
      High-affinity binding between VOCs and targets underscores their role as 
      environmental carcinogens. Strikingly, shared dysregulated pathway across HNSC, 
      LUSC, and LUAD highlight pan-respiratory susceptibility to VOC exposure. 
      Epidemiological correlations align with molecular findings, emphasizing 
      cumulative risks in populations exposed to air pollution. The study also 
      highlights FN1 and PECAM1 as key targets, emphasizing the importance of these 
      markers in VOC-associated carcinogenesis.
