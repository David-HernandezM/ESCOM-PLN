AB  - Understanding the cellular origins and early evolutionary dynamics that drive the 
      initiation of carcinogenesis is critical to advancing early detection and 
      prevention strategies. By characterizing key molecular, cellular and niche events 
      at the precancerous tipping point of early gastric cancer (EGC), we aimed to 
      develop more precise screening tools and design targeted interventions to prevent 
      malignant transformation at this stage. We utilized our AI models to integrate 
      spatial multimodal data from nine EGC endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) 
      samples (covering sequential stages from normal to cancer), construct a 
      spatial-temporal profile of disease progression, and identify a critical tipping 
      point (PMC_P) characterized by an immune-suppressive microenvironment during 
      early cancer development. At this stage, inflammatory pit mucous cells with 
      stemness (PMC_2) interact with fibroblasts via NAMPT  ⟶  ITGA5/ITGB1 and with 
      macrophages via AREG  ⟶  EGFR/ERBB2 signaling, fostering cancer initiation. We 
      established gastric precancerous cell lines and organoids to demonstrate that 
      NAMPT and AREG promote cellular proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, in the 
      transgenic CEA-SV40 mouse model, targeting AREG and/or NAMPT disrupted key cell 
      interactions, inhibited the JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFκB pathways, and reduced PD-L1 
      expression, which was also confirmed by western blot in vitro. These 
      interventions delayed disease progression, reversed the immunosuppressive 
      microenvironment, and prevented malignant transformation. Clinical validation was 
      conducted using endoscopically resected EGC specimens. Our study provides a 
      precise spatiotemporal depiction of EGC development and identifies novel 
      diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for early intervention.
