AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of prenatal acetaminophen exposure on the 
      future development of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 
      children. DATA SOURCES: Literature searches of MEDLINE (1975 to June 2015), 
      International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1975 to June 2015), and Cochrane Database 
      (publications through June 2015) for prospective clinical trials assessing the 
      relationship of prenatal acetaminophen exposure and the development of attention 
      deficit disorders or hyperactivity. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies 
      comparing self-reported maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy to 
      development of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors in offspring between the ages of 3 and 
      12 years. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies examining the effects of prenatal 
      acetaminophen exposure on subsequent ADHD behaviors were identified. Of these, 
      one early study found no link to ADHD behaviors while the other studies found 
      statistically significant correlations with the most prominent being a study 
      finding a higher risk for using ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 
      1.15-1.44) or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years as determined by the 
      Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27) 
      in children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: While 
      there does appear to be a mild correlation between prenatal acetaminophen use and 
      the development of ADHD symptoms in children, current data do not provide 
      sufficient evidence that prenatal acetaminophen exposure leads to development of 
      ADHD symptoms late in life. Acetaminophen is a preferred option for pain 
      management during pregnancy when compared with other medications such as 
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids for pyretic or pain relief.
