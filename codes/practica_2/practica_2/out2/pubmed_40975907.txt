AB  - BACKGROUND: Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome 
      (PIICS) drives severe metabolic dysregulation and hepatic injury, characterized 
      by hepatocyte damage and fibrosis. While curcumin (CUR) exhibits hepatoprotective 
      properties, its role in PIICS-induced liver injury remains unexplored. METHODS: 
      This study investigates the efficacy and mechanisms of CUR against PIICS-induced 
      hepatic damage. Murine PIICS models underwent hepatic histopathology (H&E 
      staining, TEM), RNA sequencing, and targeted metabolomics to identify injury 
      markers. CUR's effects were assessed via biochemical, transcriptomic, and 
      metabolomic analyses. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and qPCR were 
      employed to validate CUR targets. RESULTS: PIICS mice exhibited elevated serum 
      ALT, AST, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, alongside histopathological evidence of 
      inflammatory infiltration. Transcriptomics revealed dysregulation in lipid 
      metabolism, redox homeostasis, and iron-binding pathways. Metabolomics identified 
      hepatic polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) depletion, increased ferrous ions, 
      lipid peroxidation (4-HNE, MDA), and reduced antioxidants (GSH, SOD). CUR 
      treatment alleviated liver injury, restored redox balance, and suppressed 
      ferroptosis markers. Integrated analyses demonstrated that CUR targets 
      ferroptosis-related pathways, modulating lipid metabolism, iron homeostasis, and 
      oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: CUR mitigates PIICS-induced liver injury by 
      counteracting ferroptosis through modulation of lipid metabolism, iron 
      homeostasis, and oxidative stress, offering a promising therapeutic strategy.
