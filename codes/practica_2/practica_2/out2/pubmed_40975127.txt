AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages depend on their amino acid metabolism to 
      determine their properties and immune function and play important roles in the 
      tumor microenvironment (TME). Although in previous studies, targeting amino acid 
      metabolism to transform the protumor function of tumor-associated macrophages 
      (TAMs) into antitumor immune function has shown promising application as a tumor 
      therapy, current clinical research is still limited. There is a lack of 
      discussion on the mechanism and treatment strategy for determining tumor 
      progression by controlling amino acid metabolism in TAMs, as does a summary of 
      studies on promoting tumor progression by reshaping amino acid metabolism in 
      TAMs. AIM OF REVIEW: This review aims to systematically review and summarize the 
      crosstalk between amino acid metabolism in TAMs and the TME, analyze the 
      determining role of its metabolic network in tumor occurrence and development, 
      and summarize therapies on this basis to help determine the development status 
      and emerging technologies in the field of amino acid metabolism in TAMs for tumor 
      therapy. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: This review dissects how TAMs exploit 
      amino acid dynamics via transporters, enzymes, and sensors to adopt protumoral 
      phenotypes, depleting critical metabolites and crippling antitumor T-cell 
      responses. We map the immunometabolic crosstalk through which TAMs reshape 
      immunity, highlighting nutrient competition and metabolic byproducts as dual 
      drivers of immune dysfunction. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these 
      pathways (IFN-γ-JAK-STAT1 and IL-6/JAK2/STAT3) have been critically evaluated for 
      their potential to reprogram TAMs and reverse immunosuppression. Key challenges, 
      such as TAM heterogeneity, metabolic plasticity, and therapy resistance, are 
      addressed, emphasizing the need for single-cell-resolution mapping of TAM 
      metabolic states to identify context-dependent vulnerabilities. Finally, we 
      advocate for combinatorial approaches that couple metabolic rewiring with 
      immunotherapies, proposing that disrupting amino acid dependencies in TAMs could 
      dismantle the immunosuppressive TME.
