AB  - Sexual differentiation in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe promotes 
      cell cycle arrest and extensive changes in gene expression, resulting in 
      cell-to-cell fusion, the exchange of hereditary material and specialized cell 
      division. These events are detrimental to the cell if they are triggered in 
      inappropriate conditions, and therefore the decision to differentiate must be 
      precisely controlled. Here, we investigated the role of the RNA-binding protein 
      Zfs1 in this process by identifying its targets and characterizing novel 
      post-translational regulatory mechanisms. We found that Zfs1 negatively regulates 
      the G1 cyclin Puc1, and deregulated Puc1 levels inhibit differentiation in the 
      zfs1Δ mutant. We also found that Zfs1 undergoes phosphorylation, which is 
      stimulated upon nitrogen depletion or inhibition of the TOR pathway. 
      Phosphorylation of Zfs1 modulates accumulation of Puc1 and plays an important 
      role in the response of the cell to sexual differentiation signals. We propose 
      that Zfs1 functions as an integrator of nutrient information to modulate sexual 
      differentiation, contributing to the establishment of the 
      differentiation-activating threshold.
