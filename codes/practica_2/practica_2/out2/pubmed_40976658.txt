AB  - INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy ranks as one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, 
      with poorly controlled seizures imposing a significant disease burden. 
      Subclinical epileptiform discharges (SEDs) have been linked to cognitive and 
      behavioural impairments in children. There is a growing trend in clinical 
      practices towards increased use of antiseizure medications (ASMs), as they have 
      the potential to alleviate the impact of SEDs in children. Nonetheless, 25-30% of 
      epilepsy patients do not respond to current antiepileptic treatments. Lacosamide 
      (LCM), a third-generation ASM, has demonstrated established efficacy and 
      tolerability in both adults and children with epilepsy. However, there is a 
      scarcity of studies on LCM as a monotherapy for paediatric patients with epilepsy 
      and SEDs. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of LCM monotherapy in 
      epilepsy patients, as well as to examine the impact of LCM on patients with SED. 
      METHODS: This prospective cohort study, conducted at a single centre and 
      employing an open-label approach, aims to administer LCM antiepileptic treatment 
      to children while taking into account their seizure profiles, 
      electroencephalogram results, cognitive development and other relevant factors. 
      The index date, marking the administration of the first LCM dose, defines the 
      beginning of the study. The baseline period encompasses the 3 months leading up 
      to the index date, and each child will be monitored until the addition, switch or 
      discontinuation of study drugs, death, completion of a full 1-year follow-up or 
      the conclusion of the study period. Assessments will be conducted every 3 months 
      throughout the follow-up period. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study received 
      approval from the Ethics Committee of the Children's Hospital Affiliated with 
      Chongqing Medical University (file number: 2024-210), and all participating sites 
      have obtained the necessary approvals. This study has been registered with the 
      Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Written informed consent will be sought from the 
      parents or guardians of potential participants under 16 years of age at the 
      outpatient clinic. Additionally, older children with normal cognitive function 
      will be asked to provide their own version of written informed consent. 
      Participation in the study is voluntary, and individuals or their 
      parents/guardians who choose not to provide consent will not be included in the 
      study. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR2400092710.
