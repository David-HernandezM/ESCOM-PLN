      and Machine Learning Approaches.

AB  - A growing body of evidence now suggests that precision psychiatry, an 
      interdisciplinary field of psychiatry, precision medicine, and pharmacogenomics, 
      serves as an indispensable foundation of medical practices by offering the 
      accurate medication with the accurate dose at the accurate time to patients with 
      psychiatric disorders. In light of the latest advancements in artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning techniques, numerous biomarkers and genetic 
      loci associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments are being 
      discovered in precision psychiatry research by employing neuroimaging and 
      multi-omics. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for precision 
      psychiatry research using artificial intelligence and machine learning 
      approaches, such as deep learning and neural network algorithms, together with 
      multi-omics and neuroimaging data. Firstly, we review precision psychiatry and 
      pharmacogenomics studies that leverage various artificial intelligence and 
      machine learning techniques to assess treatment prediction, prognosis prediction, 
      diagnosis prediction, and the detection of potential biomarkers. In addition, we 
      describe potential biomarkers and genetic loci that have been discovered to be 
      associated with psychiatric diseases and relevant treatments. Moreover, we 
      outline the limitations in regard to the previous precision psychiatry and 
      pharmacogenomics studies. Finally, we present a discussion of directions and 
      challenges for future research.
