AB  - BACKGROUND: The heritability of several psychiatric disorders is high, and 
      specific at-risk variants have been identified. Therefore, genetic counseling and 
      genetic testing can be prescribed to some psychiatric patients, but these 
      services are not standardized for most of the population. The aims of the study 
      were to gather opinions from mental health professionals and users regarding (a) 
      the genetics of psychiatric disorders and (b) the usefulness of a genetic 
      counseling unit in psychiatry. METHODS: The survey was conducted in the province 
      of Tarragona (Spain), and we analyzed 152 valid questionnaires from professionals 
      and 959 from users. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of professionals strongly believed 
      that psychiatric disorders have a genetic basis, and 59% rated a genetic 
      counseling unit in psychiatry as very or extremely useful. However, only a few 
      professionals reported that patients asked them about the genetics of their 
      diseases (12%) or the possibility of transmitting the disease to offspring (19%). 
      Forty-seven percent of users strongly believed that psychiatric disorders have a 
      genetic basis, 30% responded that they talked with their families about the 
      genetics of their diseases, and 43% were worried about transmitting the disease 
      to offspring; however, only 14% reported that their psychiatrist had talked to 
      them about this topic. Remarkably, 80% of users would consider a genetic 
      counseling unit very or extremely useful. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed 
      that mental health professionals were more aware of the genetic basis of 
      psychiatric disorders than users, and both considered the implementation of a 
      genetic counseling service very useful.
