TI  - Association of the triglyceride-glucose index combined with a body shape index 
      with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with 
      cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome stage 0-3: findings from two prospective 
      cohorts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, as a measure of insulin 
      resistance, has been confirmed to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. 
      The new composite indicator, TyG-A body type index (TyG-ABSI), by integrating the 
      TyG index and the A body type index, has demonstrated superior efficacy in 
      predicting the risk of cardiovascular death in the general population compared to 
      traditional indicators. This study aims to deeply explore the association between 
      TyG-ABSI and all-cause mortality and CVD mortality in the population with 
      cardiovascular kidney-metabolic syndrome (CKM) stages 0-3. The analysis will be 
      conducted from multiple dimensions such as the intensity of indicator correlation 
      and potential influencing mechanisms, in order to comprehensively reveal the 
      relationship between the two. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 13,480 participants 
      in the NHANES cohort (1999-2018) using Cox proportional hazards models and 
      restricted cubic spline functions. The results indicated that elevated TyG-ABSI 
      values were independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality 
      (HR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.104-1.361) and cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.377, 95% CI 
      1.149-1.651). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
      concordance index evaluations demonstrated that TyG-ABSI yielded more accurate 
      long-term prognostic performance than other TyG-derived metrics. The area under 
      the curve (AUC) of this indicator reached 0.688-0.708 in the prediction of 
      all-cause mortality risk over 5-15 years, and 0.696-0.739 in the prediction of 
      cardiovascular mortality risk. External validation using CHARLS data confirmed 
      the robustness of these findings in predicting all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Among individuals with CKM stages 0-3, TyG-ABSI demonstrates a stronger 
      association with mortality risk and superior predictive ability compared with 
      other TyG-derived metrics. Its performance suggests a potential role in capturing 
      variations across diverse clinical subgroups, and informing optimal timing for 
      preventive interventions.
