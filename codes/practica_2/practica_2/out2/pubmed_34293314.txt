AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may 
      be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental deficits and disorders, but evidence is 
      inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether prenatal exposure to PFAS were 
      associated with childhood diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: This study was based on the 
      Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study and included n = 821 ADHD cases, 
      n = 400 ASD cases and n = 980 controls. Diagnostic cases were identified by 
      linkage with the Norwegian Patient Registry. In addition, we used data from the 
      Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The study included the following PFAS measured 
      in maternal plasma sampled mid-pregnancy: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), 
      perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic 
      acid (PFUnDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid 
      (PFHpS), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Relationships between individual 
      PFAS and ADHD or ASD diagnoses were examined using multivariable adjusted 
      logistic regression models. We also tested for possible non-linear 
      exposure-outcome associations. Further, we investigated the PFAS mixture 
      associations with ASD and ADHD diagnoses using a quantile-based g-computation 
      approach. RESULTS: Odds of ASD was significantly elevated in PFOA quartile 2 
      [OR = 1.71 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.45)] compared to quartile 1, and PFOA appeared to 
      have a non-linear, inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship with ASD. PFOA 
      was also associated with increased odds of ADHD, mainly in quartile 2 [OR = 1.54 
      (95% CI: 1.16, 2.04)] compared to quartile 1, and displayed a non-linear 
      relationship in the restricted cubic spline model. Several PFAS (PFUnDA, PFDA, 
      and PFOS) were inversely associated with odds of ADHD and/or ASD. Some of the 
      associations were modified by child sex and maternal education. The overall PFAS 
      mixture was inversely associated with ASD [OR = 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.90)] as 
      well as the carboxylate mixture [OR = 0.79 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.93)] and the 
      sulfonate mixture [OR = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.96)]. CONCLUSION: Prenatal exposure 
      to PFOA was associated with increased risk of ASD and ADHD in children. For some 
      PFAS, as well as their mixtures, there were inverse associations with ASD and/or 
      ADHD. However, the inverse associations reported herein should not be interpreted 
      as protective effects, but rather that there could be some unresolved confounding 
      for these relationships. The epidemiologic literature linking PFAS exposures with 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes is still inconclusive, suggesting the need for more 
      research to elucidate the neurotoxicological potential of PFAS during early 
      development.
