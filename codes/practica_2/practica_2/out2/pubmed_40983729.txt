TI  - Fusobacterium nucleatum: ecology, pathogenesis and clinical implications.
LID - 10.1038/s41579-025-01237-z [doi]
AB  - Fusobacterium nucleatum, a commensal microorganism and opportunistic pathogen (a 
      pathobiont), has emerged as a key player in both local and systemic diseases. In 
      humans, F. nucleatum is found in the oral microbiota, but under certain 
      conditions, it can spread to other ecological niches within the body, such as the 
      gut microbiota. Importantly, F. nucleatum has a pathogenic role in periodontal 
      disease, inflammatory bowel disease and various cancers, particularly colorectal 
      cancer. F. nucleatum can promote oncogenesis via several mechanisms, including 
      virulence factors, chronic inflammation, immune evasion and direct interactions 
      with tumour cells. The strong link between this pathobiont microorganism and 
      cancer has led to the emergence of several potential diagnostic strategies and 
      possible therapeutic interventions. Given its increasing association with cancer 
      progression and poor clinical outcomes, understanding the role of F. nucleatum in 
      disease treatment offers critical insights for future research and clinical 
      applications. This Review underscores the importance of F. nucleatum in 
      microbiology, oncology and translational medicine.
