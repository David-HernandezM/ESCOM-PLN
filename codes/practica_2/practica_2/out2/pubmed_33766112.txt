AB  - BACKGROUND: Our previous study on the 2016/2017 Serie A season showed that a 
      greater likelihood of reaching the top positions in the Italian league "Serie A" 
      seemed to be mainly related to sprint activity, goal attempts, total throws, 
      target shots and assists. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the following season data 
      in the same league to compare, confirm, and improve these results. METHODS: The 
      data of all the matches played during the "Serie A" 2017-2018 season were 
      obtained from the Italian soccer league. The teams' analysis was performed in 
      terms of total distance covered in km, jogging, running and sprint activities, 
      average speed, and match statistics (total shots, shots on target, goal attempts, 
      assists, turnovers, and steals). RESULTS: Teams that reached the first four 
      positions revealed a lower percentage of running (65.98 ± 1.51 vs. 66.84 ± 2.18; 
      p < 0.001), a higher percentage of jogging (25.61 ± 1.71 vs. 25.30 ± 1.97; 
      p = 0.037) and sprint activities (8.41 ± 1.04 vs. 7.86 ± 0.82; p < 0.001). Match 
      statistics seem to be statistically different between the first four teams the 
      other teams. The total goals are strongly associated both with the total score at 
      the end of the championship (R = 0.906; p < 0.001) and with the position in the 
      final ranking (R = 0.850; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 
      high-level teams have a lower running rate and a higher percentage of jogging and 
      sprinting than other teams.
