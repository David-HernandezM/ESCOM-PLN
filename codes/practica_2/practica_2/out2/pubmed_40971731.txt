TI  - Honeysuckle-Derived Nanovesicles Regulate Gut Microbiota for the Treatment of 
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and 
      Crohn's disease, significantly impairs patients' quality of life and is 
      characterized by a compromised intestinal barrier, pathogenic bacterial 
      colonization, and chronic inflammation. The gut microbiota has emerged as a 
      therapeutic target for IBD owing to its role in modulating immune responses, 
      metabolic pathways, and barrier function. In this study, the therapeutic 
      potential of honeysuckle-derived nanovesicles (HNVs) in a dextran sodium 
      sulfate-induced murine model of UC is investigated. Oral administration of HNVs 
      alleviates colitis symptoms, reduces colonic inflammation and histopathological 
      damage, restores Treg/Th17 balance, and repairs intestinal barrier integrity. 
      These effects are associated with favorable alterations in the gut microbiota, 
      including an increase in beneficial bacteria and a decrease in pathogenic 
      species, along with elevated levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are 
      essential for maintaining mucosal immunity and barrier function. Moreover, 
      metabolomic analysis reveals that HNVs promoted bile acid (BA) absorption and 
      regulated BA metabolism, contributing to the maintenance of intestinal immune 
      homeostasis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the protective effects of 
      HNVs through modulation of SCFA levels and BA metabolism, supporting their 
      potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of IBD.
