AB  - Animal body coverings provide protection and allow for adaptation to 
      environmental pressures such as heat, ultraviolet radiation, water loss, and 
      mechanical forces. Here, using a comparative genomics analysis of 39 mammal 
      species spanning three skin covering types (hairless, scaly and spiny), we found 
      some genes (e.g., UVRAG, POLH, and XPC) involved in skin inflammation, skin 
      innate immunity, and ultraviolet radiation damage repair were under selection in 
      hairless ocean mammals (e.g., whales and manatees). These signatures might be 
      associated with a high risk of skin diseases from pathogens and ultraviolet 
      radiation. Moreover, the genomes from three spiny mammal species shared 
      convergent genomic regions (EPHB2, EPHA4, and NIN) and unique positively selected 
      genes (FZD6, INVS, and CDC42) involved in skin cell polarity, which might be 
      related to the development of spines. In scaly mammals, the shared convergent 
      genomic regions (e.g., FREM2) were associated with the integrity of the skin 
      epithelium and epidermal adhesion. This study identifies potential convergent 
      genomic features among distantly related mammals with the same skin covering 
      type.
