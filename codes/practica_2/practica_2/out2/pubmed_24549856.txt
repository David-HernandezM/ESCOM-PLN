AB  - Lung cancer is the most dreaded of all cancers because of the higher mortality 
      rates associated with it worldwide. The various subtypes of lung cancer respond 
      differently to a particular treatment regime, which makes the therapeutic 
      interventions all the more complicated. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) 
      is based primarily on the clinical and experimental observations that indicate 
      the existence of a subpopulation of cells with the capacity to self-renew and 
      differentiate as well as show increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. 
      They are considered as the factors responsible for the cases of tumor relapse. 
      The CSCs may have significant role in the development of lung tumorigenesis based 
      on the identification of the CSCs which respond during injury. The properties of 
      multi-potency and self-renewal are shared in common by the lung CSCs with the 
      normal pluripotent stem cells which can be isolated using the similar markers. 
      This review deals with the origin and characteristics of the lung cancer stem 
      cells. The role of different markers used to isolate lung CSCs like CD44, ALDH 
      (aldehyde dehydrogenase), CD133 and ABCG2 (ATP binding cassette sub family G 
      member 2) have been discussed in detail. Analysis of the developmental signaling 
      pathways such as Wnt/Î²-catenin, Notch, hedgehog in the regulation and maintenance 
      of the lung CSCs have been done. Finally, before targeting the lung CSC 
      biomarkers for potential therapeutics, challenges faced in lung cancer stem cell 
      research need to be taken into account. With the accepted notion that the CSCs 
      are to blame for cancer relapse and drug resistance, targeting them can be an 
      important aspect of lung cancer therapy in the future.
