TI  - Effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on heart failure outcomes and 
      cardiovascular death across varying cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic comorbidity.

AB  - AIMS: Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on heart 
      failure hospitalization (HFH) and cardiovascular (CV) death among patients with 
      varying overlap of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) comorbidity are not well 
      characterized. This study aimed to assess effects GLP-1RAs on HFH and CV death 
      across populations with varying type and number of CKM comorbidity. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Online databases were queried through November 2024 for primary and 
      secondary analyses of clinical outcome trials of GLP-1RAs in patients with heart 
      failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
      obesity, and combinations of these diseases. Primary outcome was a composite HFH 
      or CV death. Secondary outcomes were first HFH and CV death. Hazard ratios (HRs), 
      risk ratios (RRs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived using 
      random-effects models. Fifteen trials (n = 87 549) were included. Compared with 
      placebo, GLP-1RAs reduced the relative risk of composite HFH/CV death in HF (HR 
      0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.96), T2DM (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93), and obesity (HR 0.70, 
      95% CI 0.58-0.86), with a non-significant risk reduction in CKD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 
      0.61-1.01). GLP-1RAs reduced the risk of HFH in T2DM (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.99) 
      and obesity (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.87), with a non-significant risk reduction 
      among patients with HF (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.04) and CKD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 
      0.64-1.06). GLP-1RAs also significantly reduced CV death in HF (HR 0.88, 95% CI 
      0.77-0.99), T2DM (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93), and in obesity (HR 0.83, 95% CI 
      0.73-0.93), with a non-significant risk reduction in CKD (HR 0.80, 95% CI 
      0.60-1.08). Effects were consistent across subgroups, except for HF with reduced 
      ejection fraction (HFrEF), where GLP-1RAs showed a non-significant risk increase 
      in HFH (HR 1.17, 95% CI 0.93-1.47) but significantly reduced CV death (HR 0.67, 
      95% CI 0.50-0.90). GLP-1RAs were not associated with increased risk for serious 
      adverse events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Glucagon-like peptide-1 
      receptor agonists reduce HFH and CV death across CKM conditions, with generally 
      consistent effects in varying combinations of these diseases. The potential 
      exception is among patients with HFrEF, where a reduction in risk of CV death, 
      but a numeric increase in HFH, was observed. Definitive CV outcome trials are 
      needed to definitively determine effects of GLP-1RAs in patients with established 
      HFrEF.
