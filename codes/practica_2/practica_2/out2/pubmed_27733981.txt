AB  - BACKGROUND: Introspection into the factors that affect student success at higher 
      education institutions has gained significant momentum in recent years. Teaching 
      and learning has come under the spotlight with quality enhancement and teaching 
      development funding focussing on student support, enhancing the student 
      environment, and enhancing academics as teachers. Included in this are aspects 
      that try to understand the student. An aspect that is not receiving attention is 
      student health, specifically headaches which could impact student success. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the impact of primary headaches on student 
      academic, family and social life at one higher education institution in South 
      Africa. METHOD: Data was collected using a questionnaire based descriptive cross 
      sectional survey. Multistage sampling using a ballot method allowed for sampling 
      to obtain representation from across the institution. To achieve a 95 % 
      confidence level, 384 students from across the university were invited to 
      participate after informed consent. Data was analysed using Chi square tests at a 
      probability of p < 0.05. RESULTS: Majority of the participants were 
      undergraduates and non-smokers. Half of the population suffered from primary 
      headaches. Headache sufferers experienced limited concentration due to an 
      increased headache intensity during tests and/or the examination period. This 
      negatively impacted on studying which was aggravated by consumption of 
      caffeinated energy drinks, coffee and chocolate resulting in a less effective 
      study session. Activities of daily living and participation in social events 
      which usually leads to relaxation were neglected. Personal and emotional 
      well-being was also negatively affected. Altered sleeping patterns and absence of 
      study breaks also led to headaches. CONCLUSION: Headaches were found to impact on 
      the students study and sleep patterns, their attention levels during lectures and 
      their social and emotional life. Headaches negatively impacted on some 
      participants leading to reduced focus on academic, family, social or leisure 
      activities. Intensity of headaches increased during tests and examinations which 
      could impact their success at University.
