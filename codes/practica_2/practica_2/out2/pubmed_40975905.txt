AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical decision-making is a core competency in emergency nursing, 
      requiring rapid and accurate assessments. With the growing integration of 
      Generative Artificial Intelligence in healthcare, there is a pressing need to 
      understand its potential as a clinical decision support tool. While Generative 
      Artificial Intelligence models show high accuracy and consistency, their ability 
      to navigate complex, context-sensitive scenarios remains in question. OBJECTIVES: 
      This study aimed to compare the clinical decision-making performance of emergency 
      nurses from Israel and Italy with Generative Artificial Intelligence models 
      (Claude-3.5, ChatGPT-4.0, and Gemini-1.5). It evaluated differences in severity 
      assessment, hospitalization decisions, and test selection, while exploring the 
      influence of demographic and professional characteristics on decision accuracy. 
      METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted among 82 emergency 
      nurses (49 from Italy, 33 from Israel), each independently evaluating five 
      standardized clinical cases. Their decisions were compared with those generated 
      by Generative Artificial Intelligence models using a structured evaluation 
      rubric. Statistical analyses included ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic 
      regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess 
      predictive accuracy. RESULTS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models exhibited 
      higher overall decision accuracy and stronger alignment with expert 
      recommendations. However, notable discrepancies emerged in hospitalization 
      decisions and severity assessments. For example, in Case 2, Generative Artificial 
      Intelligence rated severity as level 1, while Italian and Israeli nurses rated it 
      at 1.98 and 2.23, respectively (P < 0.01, F = 199). In Case 1, only 4.1 % of 
      Italian nurses recommended hospitalization compared to 30.3 % of Israeli nurses, 
      whereas all Generative Artificial Intelligence models advised hospitalization. 
      Nurses showed greater variability in test selection and severity judgments, 
      reflecting their use of clinical intuition and contextual reasoning. Demographics 
      such as age, gender, and years of experience did not significantly predict 
      accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Generative Artificial Intelligence models demonstrated 
      consistency and expert alignment but lacked the contextual sensitivity vital in 
      emergency care. These results highlight the potential of Generative Artificial 
      Intelligence as a clinical decision-support tool while emphasizing the continued 
      importance of human clinical judgment.
