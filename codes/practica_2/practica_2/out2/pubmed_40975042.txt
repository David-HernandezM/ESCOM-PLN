AB  - BACKGROUND: Shexiang Baoxin Pill (SBP) is a traditional Chinese medicine used to 
      treat ischemic cardiomyopathy. It can alleviate cardiac fibrosis following 
      myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury, but its action mechanism remains 
      unclear. PURPOSE: To elucidate the mechanism by which SBP alleviates cardiac 
      fibrosis. METHODS: snRNA-seq was employed to construct a cardiac cell atlas of 
      MI/R mice treated with SBP, identify DEGs in fibroblasts, and analyse 
      transcription factor activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics 
      simulations were used to investigate the binding sites and binding stability of 
      the screened SBP chemical components with the STAT3 protein. 
      Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR and WB techniques were utilized 
      to assess the impact of SBP treatment on cardiac fibrosis and myofibroblast 
      transition, while echocardiography was used to evaluate cardiac function in mice. 
      RESULTS: SBP treatment significantly improved cardiac function in mice subjected 
      to MI/R injury: cardiac fibrosis area was reduced by 4.2 %, EF was increased by 
      4.5 % and FS was increased by 2.5 %. snRNA-seq revealed that SBP treatment did 
      not alter the overall number of cardiac fibroblasts but modulated the 
      proportional distribution of their subtypes. SCENIC-based transcription factor 
      activity analysis suggested that the STAT3 signalling pathway might play a key 
      role in this process. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that H/R treatment 
      induced the transition of fibroblasts into α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts, which 
      SBP inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated for the first time that 
      SBP effectively attenuates cardiac fibrosis post-MI/R, and elucidated the 
      mechanism by which SBP inhibits myofibroblast transdifferentiation via the STAT3 
      signaling pathway.
