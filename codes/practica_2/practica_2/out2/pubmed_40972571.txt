AB  - Extrachromosomal, circular DNA (ecDNA) is a prevalent oncogenic alteration in 
      cancer genomes, often associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient 
      outcome. While previous studies proposed a chromatin-based mobile enhancer model 
      for ecDNA-driven oncogenesis, its precise mechanism and impact remains unclear 
      across diverse cancer types. Our study, utilizing advanced multi-omics profiling, 
      epigenetic editing, and imaging approaches in three cancer models, reveals that 
      ecDNA hubs are an integrated part of nuclear condensates and exhibit cancer-type 
      specific chromatin connectivity. Epigenetic silencing of the ecDNA-specific 
      regulatory modules or chemically disrupting nuclear condensates breaks down ecDNA 
      hubs, displaces MED1 co-activator binding, inhibits oncogenic transcription, and 
      promotes cell death. These findings substantiate the trans-activator function of 
      ecDNA and underscore a structural mechanism driving oncogenesis. This refined 
      understanding expands our views of oncogene regulation and opens potential 
      avenues for alternative therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.
