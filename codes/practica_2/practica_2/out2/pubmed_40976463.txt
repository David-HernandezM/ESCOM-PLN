AB  - Interleukin-11 (IL-11), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, plays a pivotal 
      role in driving pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer progression. As a 
      distinct regulator, IL-11 exerts contrasting effects depending on the disease 
      context. During acute inflammation, IL-11 maintains alveolar integrity, mitigates 
      oxidative stress, and modulates immune responses. However, chronic IL-11 
      signaling promotes airway remodeling and fibrosis in diseases such as asthma, 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
      (IPF). We propose an ecological model in which IL-11 acts as a "keystone species" 
      within interconnected pulmonary niches-epithelial, stromal, and immune cells-that 
      collectively facilitate the transition from inflammation to fibrosis and 
      ultimately to cancer. Targeted therapeutic strategies against IL-11 signaling are 
      emerging, including neutralizing antibodies, receptor antagonists, engineered 
      decoy ligands, and IL-11Rα-directed fusion toxins. Additionally, RNA interference 
      (RNAi)-based approaches and small-molecule inhibitors targeting downstream IL-11 
      pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT3, MEK/ERK) have demonstrated substantial preclinical 
      efficacy. This review underscores IL-11's critical role in pulmonary disease 
      pathogenesis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Further 
      clinical validation and biomarker development are essential to translate these 
      insights into personalized treatment strategies for diseases spanning 
      inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer.
