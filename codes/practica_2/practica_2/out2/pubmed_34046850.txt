TI  - Prenatal and postnatal exposure to acetaminophen in relation to autism spectrum 
      and attention-deficit and hyperactivity symptoms in childhood: Meta-analysis in 
      six European population-based cohorts.

AB  - The potential etiological role of early acetaminophen exposure on Autism Spectrum 
      Conditions (ASC) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is 
      inconclusive. We aimed to study this association in a collaborative study of six 
      European population-based birth/child cohorts. A total of 73,881 mother-child 
      pairs were included in the study. Prenatal and postnatal (up to 18 months) 
      acetaminophen exposure was assessed through maternal questionnaires or 
      interviews. ASC and ADHD symptoms were assessed at 4-12 years of age using 
      validated instruments. Children were classified as having borderline/clinical 
      symptoms using recommended cutoffs for each instrument. Hospital diagnoses were 
      also available in one cohort. Analyses were adjusted for child and maternal 
      characteristics along with indications for acetaminophen use. Adjusted 
      cohort-specific effect estimates were combined using random-effects 
      meta-analysis. The proportion of children having borderline/clinical symptoms 
      ranged between 0.9 and 12.9% for ASC and between 1.2 and 12.2% for ADHD. Results 
      indicated that children prenatally exposed to acetaminophen were 19% and 21% more 
      likely to subsequently have borderline or clinical ASC (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 
      1.07-1.33) and ADHD symptoms (OR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.36) compared to 
      non-exposed children. Boys and girls showed higher odds for ASC and ADHD symptoms 
      after prenatal exposure, though these associations were slightly stronger among 
      boys. Postnatal exposure to acetaminophen was not associated with ASC or 
      ADHD symptoms. These results replicate previous work and support providing clear 
      information to pregnant women and their partners about potential long-term risks 
      of acetaminophen use.
