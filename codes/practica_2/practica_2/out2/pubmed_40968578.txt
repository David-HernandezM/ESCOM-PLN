      Cannabidiol in Individuals With Drug Resistant Epilepsies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly purified Cannabidiol (CBD, epidiolex) is approved for treating 
      Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and tuberous sclerosis 
      (TSC), with off-label use in drug-resistant epilepsies. The aim of this study is 
      to evaluate efficacy, safety, and long-term retention of CBD in a large pediatric 
      population. METHODS: We prospectively included all consecutive patients 
      initiating CBD for drug-resistant epilepsy at our pediatric tertiary center from 
      2019 to 2021. Efficacy and safety were assessed via parental questionnaires on 
      seizure and non-seizure outcomes at 1, 2, and 6 months, comparing each item to 
      prior clinic visits. Retention rate was evaluated at 18 months. RESULTS: We 
      included 103 patients (mean age 11.2 years), with 47% receiving CBD for 
      label-approved syndromes (23 DS, 15 LGS, 10 TSC) and 53% off-label. At 1 month, 
      54% of caregivers reported reduced seizure frequency and duration, with a 
      positive overall impression in 62%. By months 2-6, 48% maintained seizure 
      improvement, alongside sustained gains in communication (60%), alertness (54%), 
      and motor skills (44%). Retention rates were 97% at 1 month, 90% at 2 months, 82% 
      at 6 months, 66% at 12 months, and 55% at 18 months. Off-label use (p = 0.02), 
      male gender (p = 0.049), and older age at initiation (p = 0.03) were associated 
      with higher retention. CONCLUSIONS: CBD reduced seizures and improved non 
      seizures' morbidities in drug-resistant epilepsy. Strong 18-month retention rate, 
      including off-label use, highlights efficacy and tolerability, underscoring the 
      need for further real-world data in various rare epilepsy syndromes beyond its 
      market approval.
