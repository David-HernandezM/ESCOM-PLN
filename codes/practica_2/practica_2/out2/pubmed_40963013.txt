TI  - CRISPR activation for SCN2A-related neurodevelopmental disorders.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-025-09522-w [doi]
AB  - Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via 
      haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional(1). 
      SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental 
      disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability 
      and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy(2). Here, using SCN2A 
      haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the 
      existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue 
      neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show 
      that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional 
      knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a 
      haploinsufficiency (Scn2a(+/-)). Next, using an adeno-associated virus 
      CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic 
      and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that 
      contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A 
      haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa 
      protects Scn2a(+/-) mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we 
      also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in 
      SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the 
      potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and 
      demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate 
      neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
