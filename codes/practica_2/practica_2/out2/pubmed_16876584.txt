AB  - Weight loss in humans requires, except during an illness, some form of imposed 
      restriction on food intake or increase in energy expenditure. This necessitates 
      overcoming powerful peripheral and central signals that serve to protect against 
      negative energy balance. The identification of the systems and pathways involved 
      has come from mouse models with genetic and targeted mutations, e.g., ob/ob and 
      MC4 R(-/-) as well as rat models of obesity. Study of seasonal animals has shown 
      that they undergo annual cycles of body fattening and adipose tissue loss as 
      important adaptations to environmental change, yet these changes appear to 
      involve mechanisms distinct from those known already. One animal model, the 
      Siberian hamster, exhibits marked, but reversible, weight loss in response to 
      shortening day length. The body weight is driven by a decrease in food intake 
      with the magnitude of the loss of body weight being directly related to the 
      length of time of exposure to short photoperiod. The most important facet of this 
      response is that the point of energy balance is continuously re-adjusted during 
      the transition in body weight reflecting an apparent 'sliding set point'. Studies 
      have focused on identifying the neural basis of this mechanism. Initial studies 
      of known genes (e.g., NPY, POMC, and AgRP) both through the measurement of gene 
      expression in the arcuate nucleus as well as following intracerebroventricular 
      (i.c.v.) injection indicated that the systems involved are not those involved in 
      restoring energy balance following energy deficits. Instead, a novel mechanism of 
      regulation is implied. Recent studies have begun to explore the neural basis of 
      the seasonal body weight response. A discrete and novel region of the posterior 
      arcuate nucleus, the dorsal medial posterior arcuate nucleus (dmpARC) has been 
      identified, where a battery of gene expression changes for signalling molecules 
      (vgf and histamine H3 receptor) and transcription factors (RXRgamma and RAR) 
      occur in association with seasonal changes in body weight. This work provides the 
      basis of a potentially novel mechanism of energy balance regulation.
