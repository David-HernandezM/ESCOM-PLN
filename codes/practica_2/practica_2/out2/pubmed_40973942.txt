AB  - BACKGROUND: The global burden of cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases has 
      remained substantial and continues to evolve in response to shifting etiological 
      patterns. While viral hepatitis and alcohol use have historically dominated, 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as a major contributor 
      worldwide. A comprehensive understanding of these trends across regions and 
      sociodemographic levels is essential for targeted public health interventions. 
      METHODS: We analyzed data on cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases from 1990 to 
      2021 using estimates from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. 
      Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), prevalence rate (ASPR), mortality rate 
      (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) were assessed globally and 
      across sociodemographic index (SDI) levels. Estimated annual percentage change 
      (EAPC) was calculated to quantify temporal trends. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, 
      NAFLD-related cirrhosis was the only etiology with a significantly increasing 
      ASIR (EAPC = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.69-0.77), while viral and alcohol-related cirrhosis 
      showed stable or declining trends. In 2021, NAFLD became the leading global cause 
      of incident cirrhosis. Although high-SDI countries demonstrated effective control 
      of HBV and HCV-related mortality, NAFLD remains a major and growing challenge. 
      The ASMR of NAFLD-related cirrhosis showed a fluctuating pattern overall but 
      increased notably in several low- to middle-SDI countries, particularly in 
      Eastern Europe (e.g., EAPC in ASMR = 3.8). HCV-related ASIRs were concentrated in 
      Central Asia, especially in Mongolia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. HBV-related 
      ASMR declined rapidly in countries with SDI below 0.65, then plateaued. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases remain a major global health 
      challenge. NAFLD has emerged as the predominant cause of incident cirrhosis, 
      affecting both high-income and lower-SDI countries, signaling a critical shift 
      toward metabolic etiologies. These findings call for urgent, region-specific 
      strategies that integrate prevention, early detection, and management of both 
      infectious and metabolic liver disease risk factors.
