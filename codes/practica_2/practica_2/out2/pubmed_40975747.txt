TI  - TRIM24-mediated K27-linked ubiquitination of ULK1 alleviates energy 
      stress-induced autophagy and promote prostate cancer growth in the context of 
      SPOP mutation.

AB  - SPOP, the most frequently mutated gene in prostate cancer, has been implicated in 
      the aberrant activation of stress granules, presenting significant challenges in 
      disease management. However, the mechanistic link between SPOP mutations and 
      cellular energy stress remains inadequately explored. In this study, we 
      demonstrate that ULK1 expression is positively correlated with both 
      loss-of-function mutations in SPOP and the upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin 
      ligase TRIM24 in human prostate cancer specimens. Mechanistically, SPOP mutations 
      induce the upregulation of TRIM24, which subsequently binds to ULK1 and catalyzes 
      its non-degradative K27-linked polyubiquitylation. This post-translational 
      modification enhances the stability of ULK1, facilitating cellular adaptation to 
      energy stress and consequently promoting prostate cancer progression. Notably, 
      pharmacological inhibition of TRIM24 using TRIM24-PROTAC (proteolysis-targeting 
      chimera) effectively suppressed tumor growth in mice bearing SPOP-mutant prostate 
      cancer cells. Collectively, these findings elucidate a pivotal role of SPOP 
      mutations in modulating energy stress responses via TRIM24-mediated ULK1 
      ubiquitylation and underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting TRIM24 in 
      SPOP-mutant prostate cancers.
