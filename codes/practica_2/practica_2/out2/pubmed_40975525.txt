AB  - The Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV) 
      management guideline was last updated and published as part of the Kidney 
      Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for 
      the Management of Glomerular Diseases. Based on new developments in IgAN 
      assessment and therapy, a major update of the guideline was necessary in 2024. 
      Compared with the last version, the KDIGO 2025 IgAN guideline now encourages a 
      more liberal kidney biopsy policy and suggests aiming for stricter proteinuria 
      control, with a goal of <0.5 g/d, ideally <0.3 g/d, and a stable estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate. A major new concept in the 2025 guideline is to 
      initiate treatment with (i) therapies that prevent or reduce pathogenic IgA 
      production and IgA/IgA and IgA/IgG immune complex formation along with (ii) 
      therapies to manage the consequences of existing IgAN-induced nephron loss. 
      Approaches to achieve the first aim are currently limited to targeted-release 
      budesonide (Nefecon) or reduced-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy and, in 
      Chinese patients, mycophenolate mofetil. Approaches to the more generic second 
      aim include healthy lifestyle education, renin-angiotensin system blockers, 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and/or dual endothelin angiotensin 
      receptor blockers. Little has changed for special situations of IgA-dominant 
      immune complex glomerular diseases such as nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney 
      injury, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and pregnancy in IgAN, or 
      children with IgAN or IgAV, given the lack of major clinical trials in these 
      patient populations. Here, we provide an executive summary of the most important 
      changes in the KDIGO 2025 IgAN and IgAV guideline as a quick reference.
