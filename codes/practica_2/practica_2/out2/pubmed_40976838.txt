AB  - INTRODUCTION: For a blood-based biomarker to be considered a confirmatory test 
      for the detection of abnormal amyloid beta (Aβ) levels, the sensitivity and 
      specificity must be equivalent to that of current cerebrospinal fluid tests. 
      METHODS: In the current study we assessed the ability of phosphorylated tau 
      (p-tau)217 and Aβ42/40 from the Lumipulse G p-tau217 and β-amyloid ratio 
      (1-42/1-40) tests, individually and combined, to predict Aβ positron emission 
      tomography status in two sub-cohorts from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and 
      Lifestyle Study of Ageing. RESULTS: Testing an Alzheimer's disease continuum 
      cohort, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 
      for the p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio reached 0.961, 93%, 92%, and 93%, respectively. 
      Validation in an intention-to-treat cohort demonstrated similar AUC (0.959), with 
      increased sensitivity (99%), decreased specificity (87%), and increased accuracy 
      (95%). Dual cut-offs generating balanced 95% sensitivity/specificity result in 
      93% accuracy. DISCUSSION: Combinations of plasma p-tau217 and Aβ42 demonstrate 
      recommended performance, confirming the presence of Aβ positivity prior to 
      selection for disease-modifying therapies. HIGHLIGHTS: The phosphorylated tau 
      (p-tau)217/amyloid beta (Aβ)42 ratio had high performance to detect Aβ positron 
      emission tomography (PET) status, with > 90% sensitivity, specificity, and 
      accuracy. p-tau217/Aβ42 ratio dual cut-offs set at 95% sensitivity and 
      specificity found 10% to 15% of participants in the intermediate zone. Cut-offs 
      derived for the intention-to-treat cohort meet confirmatory assay criteria for a 
      disease-modifying therapy and can be used in clinical settings.
