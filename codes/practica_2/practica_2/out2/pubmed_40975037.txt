AB  - INTRODUCTION: The global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly 
      among biofilm-forming bacteria and fungi, has created an urgent need for novel 
      therapeutics. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a plant-derived polyphenolic 
      lignan, has demonstrated promising biological activities, yet its potential as a 
      dual-action antimicrobial agent remains underexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study 
      aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities of NDGA against 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Candida albicans, 
      elucidate its mechanism of action, and assess its in vivo efficacy and biosafety. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: NDGA's antimicrobial activities were assessed through MIC, 
      time-kill, and biofilm disruption assays against standard and clinical isolates. 
      Transcriptomic profiling and deep-learning-guided molecular docking were used to 
      identify key microbial targets and regulatory pathways. In vivo efficacy was 
      validated in Galleria mellonella and murine systemic infection models. 
      Cytotoxicity, hemolysis, and acute toxicity assays were conducted to evaluate 
      biosafety. RESULTS: NDGA exhibited potent antimicrobial activity, with MIC values 
      of 32 μg/ml for S. aureus USA300 and 64 μg/ml for C. albicans SC5314. It 
      effectively eradicated persister cells and disrupting mature biofilms of both 
      MRSA and C. albicans. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that NDGA modulated 
      multiple microbial virulence and biofilm-regulating pathways, including arginine 
      biosynthesis in MRSA and ergosterol metabolism in C. albicans. Docking studies 
      confirmed strong binding affinity of NDGA to critical microbial targets. In vivo, 
      NDGA significantly improved survival rates, reduced pathogen burden, and 
      alleviated tissue damage, showing comparable efficacy to vancomycin and 
      fluconazole. NDGA demonstrated favorable biosafety with low cytotoxicity, minimal 
      hemolysis, and no observable acute toxicity in mammalian models. CONCLUSION: NDGA 
      is a promising antimicrobial candidate capable of disrupting biofilms and 
      overcoming drug resistance in both bacterial and fungal infections. Its 
      multitargeted mode of action, coupled with in vivo efficacy and biosafety, 
      supports further development as a next-generation anti-infective agent.
