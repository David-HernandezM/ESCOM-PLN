AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway has been recognized as a 
      pivotal oncogenic driver in GBM progression. Although PI3K inhibitors have 
      demonstrated initial therapeutic efficacy, the development of resistance through 
      compensatory upregulation of alternative signaling pathways substantially limits 
      their clinical benefits. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this 
      resistance to PI3K monotherapy in GBM remain incompletely understood. METHODS: 
      Multiple patient-derived glioblastoma models including organoids (GBOs), primary 
      dissociated cells (PDCs) and xenografts (PDCX) were established as clinically 
      relevant platforms to evaluate the feasibility of tailored therapy. Comprehensive 
      molecular profiling and functional analyses were conducted across these 
      patient-derived models. RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, DNA spreading assays, 
      HR /NHEJ reporter assays and mIF were performed to elucidate the molecular 
      underpinnings of PI3K and CDK4/6 co-activation in driving tumor evolution, and to 
      reveal the synthetic lethality efficacy of the concurrent strategy. RESULTS: Our 
      findings demonstrate that PI3K monoinhibition induces aberrant CDK4/6 activation, 
      and co-activation of PI3K-CDK4/6 signaling positively correlates with monotherapy 
      resistance, which is driven by tumor evolution. The concurrent strategies with 
      PI3K and CDK4/6 inhibition synergistically achieve therapeutic efficacy in 
      suppressing the growth of GBOs, PDCs and PDCX. Mechanistically, insufficient DNA 
      damage response under PI3Ki mono-therapy upregulated CDK4/6, driving aberrant 
      cell cycle progression. The small-molecule inhibitors paxalisib and ribociclib 
      potently suppress tumor proliferation, which induced persistent replication 
      stress and genomic instability. CONCLUSIONS: Employing multiple patient-derived 
      models, our study uncovers clinically relevant PI3Ki resistance mechanisms and 
      advocates a rationale for synthetic lethality through combined PI3K-CDK4/6 
      inhibition, offering substantial therapeutic potential for GBM patients.
