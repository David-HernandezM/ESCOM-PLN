TI  - Membrane receptors cluster phosphatidylserine to activate LC3-associated 
      phagocytosis.
LID - 10.1038/s41556-025-01749-z [doi]
AB  - LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) represents a non-canonical function of 
      autophagy proteins in which ATG8-family proteins (LC3 and GABARAP proteins) are 
      lipidated onto single-membrane phagosomes as particles are engulfed by phagocytic 
      cells. LAP plays roles in innate immunity, inflammation and anticancer responses, 
      and is initiated following phagocytosis of particles that stimulate Toll-like 
      receptors (TLR) and Fc receptors as well as following engulfment of dying cells. 
      However, how this molecular process is initiated remains elusive. Here we report 
      that receptors that engage LAP enrich phosphatidylserine (PS) in the phagosome 
      membrane via membrane-proximal domains that are necessary and sufficient for LAP 
      to proceed. Subsequently, PS recruits the Rubicon-containing PI3-kinase complex 
      to initiate the enzymatic cascade leading to LAP. Manipulation of plasma membrane 
      PS content, PS binding by Rubicon or the PS-clustering domains of receptors 
      prevents LAP and delays phagosome maturation. Therefore, the initiation of LAP 
      represents a novel mechanism of PS-mediated signal transduction following 
      ligation of surface receptors.
