TI  - Creeping fat-derived mechanosensitive fibroblasts drive intestinal fibrosis in 
      Crohn's disease strictures.

AB  - A significant complication of Crohn's disease (CD) is intestinal fibrosis, which 
      narrows the bowel lumen to form a stricture. Creeping fat (CF) is the wrapping of 
      mesenteric adipose tissue around diseased bowel, of which the role in CD 
      stricture progression is unclear. By constructing a human single-cell CD 
      fibroblast atlas, we identified CF-derived, CTHRC1+ fibroblasts enriched for 
      Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif 
      (TAZ) signatures and localized to a fibrotic CF-bowel wall interface within the 
      stricture. We further showed that analogous Cthrc1+ mouse fibroblasts derive from 
      mesenteric adipose tissue stromal cells, infiltrate fibrotic bowel, and deposit 
      extracellular matrix in a YAP/TAZ-dependent manner in a mouse model of intestinal 
      fibrosis. Our findings identify CF as a key source of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts 
      and raise the possibility of improving future clinical management of stricture 
      progression by targeting not only the bowel but also CF.
