AB  - Ketogenic diets (KDs)-very-low-carbohydrate and very-high-fat diets-have gained 
      popularity as therapeutic against obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, their 
      long-term effects on metabolic health remain understudied. Here, we show that, in 
      male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss 
      but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and 
      severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed 
      mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp 
      and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and 
      cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of 
      islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and 
      disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron 
      microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin 
      granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term 
      KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their 
      systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.
