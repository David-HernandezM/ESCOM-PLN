TI  - Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and the Risk of 
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Nationwide Study in Taiwan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that a significant association exists between 
      prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and the offspring's 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) risk. However, this association 
      has largely been unexplored among the Asian population, generally, and the 
      Taiwanese population, specifically. METHODS: In our study, 950 study pairs 
      (children with ADHD [ICD-9-CM code: 314] and their mothers) and 3,800 control 
      pairs (children without ADHD and their mothers) matched by demographic 
      characteristics were identified between 1998 and 2008 from the Taiwan 
      Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. Maternal use of acetaminophen was 
      assessed in the first trimester, second trimester, and third trimester of 
      pregnancy and over the period from 3 months before pregnancy to the date of last 
      menstrual cycle. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis with adjustments for 
      demographic data, gestational infections, comorbid perinatal conditions, and 
      maternal mental health disorders indicated that exposure to acetaminophen in the 
      second trimester (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00-1.40), both the first and 
      second trimesters (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.64), or in any trimester (OR = 1.20; 
      95% CI, 1.01-1.42) was associated with an increased risk of ADHD in offspring. 
      Sensitivity analysis excluding gestational infections and maternal mental health 
      disorders confirmed this association (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69). CONCLUSION: 
      Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was associated with an increased risk of ADHD 
      in offspring, regardless of gestational infections and maternal mental health 
      disorders. Additional studies are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms 
      by which prenatal exposure to acetaminophen leads to neurodevelopmental risks.
