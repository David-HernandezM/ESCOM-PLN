TI  - Learning the natural history of human disease with generative transformers.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-025-09529-3 [doi]
AB  - Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients' past and current 
      health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course(1-3). 
      Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning 
      patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records(4,5). 
      However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify 
      the GPT(6) (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the 
      progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, 
      Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using 
      external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. 
      Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each 
      individual's past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing 
      single-disease models. Delphi-2M's generative nature also enables sampling of 
      synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential 
      disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that 
      have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods(7) provide insights into 
      Delphi-2M's predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across 
      disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also 
      highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models 
      appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are 
      applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal 
      dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of 
      personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.
