TI  - Early antiplatelet treatment for minor stroke following thrombolysis: the EAST 
      trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Antiplatelet treatment is recommended to start 24 h after 
      intravenous thrombolysis due to concerns about haemorrhagic transformation. This 
      study aimed to investigate the potential benefit of early antiplatelet after 
      intravenous thrombolysis in minor stroke. METHODS: A multicentre, double-blind, 
      randomized trial was conducted in China between 7 August 2022 and 1 August 2024, 
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early antiplatelet in acute ischaemic 
      stroke patients presenting with mild neurological deficits, as indicated by a 
      National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 0-5, who received 
      intravenous thrombolysis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 
      clopidogrel and aspirin or placebo within 6 h after intravenous thrombolysis. The 
      primary endpoint was an excellent functional outcome at 90 days, indicated by a 
      modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-1. Statistical analysis was based on a 
      modified intention-to-treat population. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, any 
      intracranial haemorrhage, and major systemic bleeding were safety endpoints. 
      RESULTS: The primary endpoint was not met in this study. Of the randomly assigned 
      1022 patients, 995 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat 
      analysis (503 with early antiplatelet treatment and 492 with placebo). The 
      primary endpoint occurred in 89.7% (451/503) of patients receiving early 
      antiplatelet vs 89.6% (441/492) of those receiving placebo with no significant 
      difference (odds ratio 1.00, 95% confidence interval .67-1.51, P = .99). Similar 
      safety profiles were found between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese 
      patients with acute minor ischaemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis, 
      early antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel plus aspirin was safe but did not 
      improve already excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at 90 days.
