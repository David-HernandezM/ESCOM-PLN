AB  - Totipotency enables single cells to regenerate an organism, yet how 
      differentiated somatic cells reacquire this potential remains unclear. Here, we 
      show that LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) reprograms SPEECHLESS (SPCH)-expressing 
      meristemoid mother cells (MMCs) away from stomatal-lineage progression, driving 
      their conversion into totipotent somatic embryo founder cells (SEFCs) in 
      Arabidopsis cotyledons. Using time-course live imaging, single-nucleus RNA 
      sequencing (snRNA-seq), and spatial laser capture microdissection combined with 
      RNA sequencing (LCM-RNA-seq), we uncover a lineage bifurcation point where MMC 
      derivatives either commit to guard cells or transition into a guard mother cell 
      (GMC)-auxin intermediate, an auxin-enriched state that enables transcriptional 
      reprogramming and embryonic gene activation. LEC2 and SPCH cooperatively activate 
      TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) and YUCCA4 (YUC4), 
      establishing a local auxin biosynthesis circuit essential for SEFC specification. 
      Genetic and promoter analyses confirm MMCs as the origin of somatic embryos, with 
      TAA1/YUC-mediated auxin production indispensable for totipotency and 
      embryogenesis. These findings define an auxin-driven, transcriptionally regulated 
      trajectory linking stomatal progenitors to somatic embryogenesis, revealing a 
      direct route that advances mechanistic understanding of plant regenerative 
      plasticity.
