AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigate shared genetic changes that contribute to the association 
      of kidney stones with cardiometabolic comorbidities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analyses were performed using the 
      UK Biobank, Mayo Clinic Biobank, and FinnGen, complemented by secondary genetic 
      association analyses. RESULTS: Genetic correlation analyses confirmed modest but 
      significant positive associations between kidney stones and hypertension, 
      obesity, and type 2 diabetes (r(g)=0.14 ∼ 0.19, all P<.001). Single nucleotide 
      variants near FTO (for expansion of gene symbols, use search tool at 
      www.genenames.org) were identified as shared risk loci across all conditions. 
      Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrated that higher body mass index (BMI) 
      and waist-hip ratio (WHR) significantly increased the risk of kidney stones, type 
      2 diabetes, and hypertension. Subsequent GWAS analyses adjusting for BMI or WHR 
      revealed a slightly reduced yet significant genetic correlation between kidney 
      stones and type 2 diabetes (BMI-adjusted: r(g)=0.18; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.28; 
      P=.001; WHR-adjusted: r(g)=0.16; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.25; P<.001), whereas the 
      association of kidney stones with hypertension was nearly eliminated. A 
      multi-trait analysis of GWAS identified one potential shared risk locus between 
      BMI-adjusted kidney stones and type 2 diabetes on chromosome 6 near LINC02537. 
      Further analyses indicated this locus is associated with thyroid-stimulating 
      hormone and free thyroxine levels. CONCLUSION: Our study highlights a critical 
      role for shared obesity-related genetic changes in the comorbid relationship 
      between kidney stones and cardiometabolic conditions. There are additional 
      genetic features related to thyroid function that are shared between kidney 
      stones and type 2 diabetes, which appear to be independent of obesity.
