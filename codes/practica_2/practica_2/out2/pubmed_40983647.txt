TI  - Intranasal vaccine combining adenovirus and trimeric subunit protein provides 
      superior immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.

AB  - Mucosal immunity provides efficient protection against upper-airway infections, 
      limiting viral shedding and transmission. However, currently, no nasal spray 
      COVID-19 vaccines are approved by WHO for global use. Here we develop a 
      two-component intranasal vaccine that combines an adenovirus vector expressing 
      the spike protein of the XBB.1.5 variant (Ad5(XBB.1.5)) with a self-assembled 
      trimeric recombinant protein derived from the receptor binding domain 
      (RBD(XBB.1.5)-HR). This two-component vaccine elicits superior humoral and 
      cellular immunity against XBB.1.5 variants compared with the individual 
      components. It also provides protective immunity against live XBB.1.16 virus 
      challenges in mice, and prevents XBB.1.5 virus transmission in a hamster model. 
      Notably, the activation of the STING signalling pathway in mucosal dendritic 
      cells is essential for the adjuvant effect of the adenovirus vector. We also 
      incorporate another trimeric protein from the BA.5 variant (RBD(BA.5)-HR), 
      creating a three-component vaccine 
      (Ad5(XBB.1.5) + RBD(XBB.1.5)-HR + RBD(BA.5)-HR) that shows enhanced 
      broad-spectrum neutralization. The two-component vaccine demonstrates high 
      tolerability and safety in humans, inducing enhanced mucosal immunity and high 
      levels of neutralizing antibodies in all participants. Our findings underscore 
      this strategy for clinical COVID-19 intranasal vaccine development.
