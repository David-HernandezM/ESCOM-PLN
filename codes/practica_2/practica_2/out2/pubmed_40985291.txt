TI  - Imaging in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: review of the current 
      literature.
LID - 10.4274/dir.2025.253249 [doi]
AB  - Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a severe, 
      life-threatening complication of pulmonary embolism with pulmonary hypertension 
      (PH). The combination of insufficient resolution of thrombi following pulmonary 
      emboli and accompanying microvascular disease results in PH. Advances in imaging 
      can offer better insight into CTEPH diagnosis and management, but lack of disease 
      awareness among radiologists has been shown to be a cause of CTEPH misdiagnosis 
      or delayed diagnosis. This review highlights features pertinent to CTEPH 
      diagnosis. The primary focus is on different modalities with their distinctive 
      signs and newly developed technologies employing artificial intelligence systems.
