AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of JAK inhibitors (JAKis) is growing in dermatology with 
      approvals for atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic 
      arthritis. This study aimed to evaluate infectious adverse events (iAEs) 
      associated with abrocitinib, baricitinib, deucravacitinib, ritlecitinib, 
      tofacitinib, and upadacitinib. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the FDA Adverse 
      Event Reporting System (FAERS) via the open-source AERSMine platform 
      (version:2025-04-16; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, USA). Reports 
      from 2004Q1 to 2024Q2 were screened under the MedDRA System Organ Class 
      "Infections and Infestations". The analysis encompassed all indications, not only 
      dermatologic use. Disproportionality metrics including Reporting Odds Ratio 
      (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), and Information Component (IC) were 
      calculated. RESULTS: Tofacitinib had the highest number of iAE reports 
      (n=68,669), followed by upadacitinib (n=17,822). Most reports involved females 
      and those aged 25-65, except baricitinib, which was more frequent in ≥66. 
      Disproportionality analysis revealed sex- and age-related differences in iAE 
      risk, with male sex generally associated with lower risk. Pediatric patients 
      (0-14 years) had an elevated iAE risk with abrocitinib and upadacitinib, while 
      older adults (≥66) showed increased risk with baricitinib and tofacitinib. 
      Commonly reported iAEs included COVID-19, herpes zoster, nasopharyngitis, 
      influenza, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and sinusitis. Each JAKi was 
      associated with distinct high-signal iAEs. CONCLUSION: This is the most 
      comprehensive real-world analysis of iAEs linked to oral JAKis. While infection 
      risks varied across agents, both common and rare but serious events were 
      identified. Findings highlight the importance of individualized monitoring and 
      preventive strategies, and reinforce the value of post-marketing surveillance in 
      ensuring safe JAKi use.
