TI  - Ninjurin-1 mediates cell lysis and detrimental inflammation of PANoptosis during 
      influenza A virus infection.

AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) induces ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis, a form of lytic 
      inflammatory cell death characterized by concurrent activation of the pyroptosis, 
      necroptosis and apoptosis pathways. Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) is a recently identified 
      mediator of plasma membrane rupture but functions diversely in different types of 
      cell death. However, little is known about the role of NINJ1 in IAV-induced 
      PANoptosis and viral pneumonia. Here, we report that IAV infection triggered an 
      increase in the expression of NINJ1, which then oligomerized and mediated cell 
      lysis in infected macrophages. The deficiency of NINJ1 prevented plasma membrane 
      rupture and the release of DAMPs and IL-1β without affecting the progression of 
      cell death. Activation of any single PANoptosis pathway was sufficient to trigger 
      the oligomerization of NINJ1 and robust cell lysis. Accordingly, only when all 
      PANoptosis pathways were concurrently blocked could the oligomerization of NINJ1, 
      cell death, and cell rupture be prevented. Ablation of NINJ1 in vivo also 
      alleviated IAV-induced lung injury and mortality. Furthermore, we revealed an 
      association between NINJ1 upregulation and poor outcomes in patients with 
      COVID-19. Collectively, our findings indicate a pivotal role of NINJ1 in the 
      immunopathology of IAV infection and its potential as a bioindicator of disease 
      severity and prognosis in viral pneumonia and viral sepsis.
