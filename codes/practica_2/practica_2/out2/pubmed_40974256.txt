AB  - BACKGROUND: Solid tumor immune suppression requires cooperation of tumor cells, 
      local immune cells, peripheral circulating immune cells, and evolution of immune 
      cell trajectories between peripheral and local environments. This study addresses 
      a significant knowledge gap by characterizing peripheral and local immune 
      environments in IDH Mutant (IDH-Mut) and IDH wildtype (IDH-WT) gliomas and 
      defines novel immunological states with prognostic relevance across the glioma 
      landscape. METHODS: We analyzed local and peripheral immune phenotypes in a 
      cohort of 18 (6 IDH-Mut and 12 IDH-WT) gliomas with distinct genetic 
      characteristics using paired human tumor and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) with single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). RESULTS: Our analyses 
      revealed unique intratumoral and peripheral immune cellular ontogenies, including 
      naïve CD4+ T cell enrichment in the IDH-Mut peripheral immune compartment, 
      monocyte enrichment in IDH-WT glioma PBMCs, and emergence of a unique population 
      of GZMH+ CD8+ T cells preferentially in the IDH-Mut microenvironment. 
      Additionally, we found upregulation of TNF-α signaling and inflammatory response 
      pathways in IDH-Mut-glioma-associated peripheral lymphoid cells versus IDH-WT 
      tumors and identified a novel population of microglia-like cells in the 
      peripheral blood of glioma patients with complement-interfacing characteristics. 
      Applying intratumoral transcriptomic deconvolution via The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      revealed genotype-independent, prognostic immune signatures across the malignant 
      glioma landscape. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals variable expression of immune 
      phenotypes in adult gliomas stratified by IDH status and characterizes immune 
      compartment and genotype-dependent differences in the immunologic glioma 
      landscape. These genotype-dependent, tumor and circulating immune ontogenies 
      should guide future diagnostic and immunotherapeutic considerations in malignant 
      glioma.
