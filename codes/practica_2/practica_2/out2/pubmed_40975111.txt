AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on patient decision making for people with systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE) are scarce. We previously showed that an evidence-based SLE 
      patient decision aid was more effective than the SLE information pamphlet 
      provided by the American College of Rheumatology in reducing decisional conflict 
      for the choice of immunosuppressive medications in women with lupus nephritis, 
      with higher acceptability and feasibility. The aim of this study was to assess 
      patient outcomes from the implementation of this SLE patient decision aid on 
      disease management in people with SLE. METHODS: This prospective implementation 
      study was done in 15 geographically diverse rheumatology clinics across the USA. 
      Adults aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of SLE identified based on a 
      medical record review were included. There were no exclusion criteria. 
      Participants were invited to view the computerised SLE patient decision aid, 
      provided through a touchscreen tablet, a website, or a smartphone app during a 
      regular clinic visit with their rheumatologist at baseline (viewing at follow-up 
      visits was optional). Participants viewed either the full or abbreviated (lite) 
      version, based on SLE disease activity and treatment, as recommended by their 
      rheumatologist. Participants completed validated computerised surveys at each of 
      the baseline, 3-month, and 6-month clinic visits on touchpad computers or their 
      mobile phone (depending on patient preference). These surveys included questions 
      related to patient decisional conflict, shared decision making, patient-physician 
      communication, and perceived acceptability and feasibility of the decision aid. 
      The main outcome of this study was to assess the impact of the SLE patient 
      decision aid (both full and lite versions) on patient decisional conflict, shared 
      decision making, patient-provider communication, and perceived acceptability and 
      feasibility. The study had a multistakeholder committee that included people with 
      lived experience of SLE. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      NCT03735238. FINDINGS: Between May 23, 2019, and Dec 12, 2023, 2005 patients with 
      SLE were assessed for eligibility and 1895 were included in the study. Study 
      participants had a mean age of 44·7 years (SD 14·4); of the 1855 respondents with 
      data on sex, 1731 (93·3%) were female and 124 (6·7%) were male; of the 1832 
      respondents with data on race, 827 (45·1%) were African American. Patient 
      outcomes were either good or excellent at the baseline visit after viewing the 
      SLE patient decision aid, including preparation for decision making. The mean Low 
      Literacy Decisional Conflict Scale score was low at 19·5 (SD 23·8); 1351 (82·8%) 
      of 1631 participants matched with their preferred role versus their actual role 
      in treatment decision making (using the control preferences scale); the mean 
      CollaboRATE score was 25·2 (SD 4·1; for patient involvement in shared decision 
      making); the mean patient-provider communication process score was 82·2 (SD 9·3); 
      and 1510 (81·4%) of 1855 participants found the decision aid to be balanced for 
      the information on immunosuppressive drugs versus glucocorticoids. Each outcome 
      score remained consistent at follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months. INTERPRETATION: 
      Patient outcomes, including shared decision making and perceived acceptability 
      and feasibility of the decision aid, were either good or excellent and persisted 
      during the implementation of a decision aid for patients with SLE. The decision 
      aid is suitable for all SLE manifestations and is freely available as a 
      smartphone app (ManageMyLupus). FUNDING: Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
