AB  - Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), remains a significant 
      health burden with poor survival rates due to late diagnosis and limited 
      treatment options. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, is the standard 
      first-line therapy for advanced HCC, but long-term use often leads to drug 
      resistance. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has 
      emerged as a crucial target in cancer therapy, showing potential to enhance 
      treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Previous studies have 
      demonstrated that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis in HCC cells and that 
      ferroptosis plays a significant role in the development of sorafenib resistance. 
      However, the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and sorafenib resistance 
      remains poorly understood, hampering the development of effective therapeutic 
      strategies. Our study focuses on the intricate interplay between ferroptosis and 
      sorafenib resistance in HCC. Using the GSE109211 dataset, we identified 
      differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes associated with sorafenib 
      resistance. Notably, these genes stratified sorafenib-resistant HCC patients into 
      distinct subgroups with different drug sensitivities, immune cell infiltrations, 
      and responses to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Through machine learning 
      algorithms, three hub genes (ECH1, SLC25A28 and ULK1) were identified to be 
      closely associated with sorafenib resistance. A novel ferroptosis-related 
      signature comprising these genes emerged as a robust diagnostic model, validated 
      by ROC curve analysis, for predicting sorafenib resistance in HCC patients. 
      Furthermore, experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of ECH1, SLC25A28 
      and ULK1 expressions in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells, with sorafenib treatment 
      altering their expression profiles. Knockdown of ULK1 in sorafenib-resistant HCC 
      cells potently enhanced sorafenib-induced ferroptosis, thereby alleviating 
      sorafenib resistance. Our findings not only identify pivotal ferroptosis-related 
      genes as diagnostic biomarkers for sorafenib resistance but also provide insights 
      into the role of ferroptosis in modulating sorafenib responsiveness. This study 
      offers a promising strategy to overcome sorafenib resistance and improve patient 
      outcomes in HCC treatment, highlighting the potential of ferroptosis-targeted 
      therapies in cancer management.
