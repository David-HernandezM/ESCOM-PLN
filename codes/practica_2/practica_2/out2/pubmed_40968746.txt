TI  - SGLT2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of heart failure: A scientific 
      statement of the HFA and the HFAI.
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.15408 [doi]
AB  - In the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) heart failure (HF) guidelines, 
      sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were recommended for the 
      prevention of HF in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and for the 
      treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Further trials showed 
      efficacy of empagliflozin and dapagliflozin in patients with HF with preserved 
      ejection fraction (HFpEF). These results prompted a broadened recommendation for 
      the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin or empagliflozin across the whole left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) spectrum in the 2023 Focused Update of the 
      ESC HF guidelines and in other international guidelines. In SOLOIST-WHF and 
      EMPULSE, sotagliflozin (enrolling only patients with T2DM) and empagliflozin, 
      respectively, were beneficial when initiated at the end or soon after an episode 
      of decompensated HF. Based on these results and on the early appearance of their 
      beneficial effects, the administration of SGLT2 inhibitors should start early in 
      patients hospitalized for acute HF. Analyses after study drug withdrawal in 
      randomized clinical trials have shown that their benefits may decline rapidly 
      after discontinuation, and thus, persistence of treatment is advised. In 
      EMPACT-MI, empagliflozin did not reduce the primary outcome of cardiovascular 
      (CV) death/HF hospitalization but reduced first/recurrent HF hospitalizations. 
      Potential benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors in further specific conditions (i.e., 
      cardiac amyloidosis, grown-up congenital heart disease and paediatric patients 
      with HF) have been reported in observational studies but need confirmation from 
      prospective trials. This scientific statement summarizes current evidence 
      regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of HF.
