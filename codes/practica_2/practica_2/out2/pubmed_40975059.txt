AB  - Matrin-3 (MATR3) is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that is associated with familial 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). MATR3 
      features two RNA recognition motifs, two zinc-finger motifs, and four 
      intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we report that human MATR3 associates 
      with itself to form nanoscale spherical assemblies at ultralow protein 
      concentrations. Through concentration-dependent associations, the spheres, which 
      are 20-30 nm in diameter, transition into wormlike assemblies. These observations 
      are reminiscent of sphere-to-worm transitions and micellization of amphiphilic 
      molecules. Using computations and experiments, we discovered that the pattern of 
      inter-domain attractions and repulsions gives MATR3 an inverse 
      bolaamphiphile-like architecture that explains the concentration-dependent 
      assembly characteristics. RNA binding causes shortening of wormlike assemblies of 
      MATR3, whereas ALS/FTD-associated mutations render MATR3 assemblies less 
      responsive to modulation by RNA. Overall, our findings highlight the unique 
      assemblies formed by MATR3 while also showing how RNA-dependent interactions and 
      ALS/FTD-associated mutations modulate the assemblies.
