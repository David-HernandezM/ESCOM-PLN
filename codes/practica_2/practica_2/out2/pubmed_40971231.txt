AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a dismal 
      prognosis, largely because of late-stage diagnosis and therapeutic resistance. 
      PDAC incidence has been rising, with modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors 
      contributing to disease development. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, 
      smoking, obesity, and familial predisposition have been implicated in PDAC 
      pathogenesis. Early clinical manifestations are vague and insidious; therefore, 
      PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, limiting curative treatment 
      options. Efforts to improve early detection have focused on serum biomarkers 
      (e.g., carbohydrate antigen 19-9), imaging modalities, and liquid biopsies. 
      Endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have demonstrated potential 
      in identifying early-stage disease in certain high-risk populations. Surgical 
      resection remains the only potentially curative option, but only 15%-20% of 
      patients have resectable disease at diagnosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has 
      emerged as a promising strategy to improve resectability and survival outcomes. 
      For patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC, combination chemotherapy 
      regimens such as FOLFIRINOX (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and 
      oxaliplatin), NALIRIFOX (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, liposomal irinotecan, and 
      leucovorin), and combined gemcitabine/nanoparticle albumen-bound paclitaxel offer 
      survival benefits, although toxicity remains a concern, especially for 
      platinum-based therapies. Several breakthroughs in molecular profiling have led 
      to the development of targeted therapies, including sotorasib and olaparib. 
      Immunotherapy has shown limited success in PDAC due to its immunosuppressive 
      tumor microenvironment. However, novel combination approaches are under 
      investigation, including quadruplet therapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors with 
      oncolytic viruses, stromal-targeting agents, and personalized neoantigen 
      vaccines. Key priorities for future research include identifying reliable 
      biomarkers for early detection, refining patient selection for targeted 
      therapies, and developing innovative strategies to overcome treatment resistance.
