      48 months in Brazilian children exposed to acetaminophen during foetal 
      development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that there is an association between 
      developmental and emotional/behavioural problems in children exposed to 
      acetaminophen during foetal development. However, few studies have focused on 
      development and behavioural outcomes in early life. OBJECTIVES: To test the 
      association between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and low neurodevelopmental 
      performance at 24 months and behavioural/emotional problems at 48 months of life. 
      METHODS: We used data from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort, a population-based 
      longitudinal prospective study. Neurodevelopment was evaluated at 24 months using 
      Battelle's Developmental Inventory (BDI) (n = 3737). We assessed global function 
      as well as each domain (personal-social, adaptative, motor, cognitive, and 
      communication). Behavioural/emotional problems were assessed at 48 months using 
      the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) (n = 3624). We used the CBCL total, 
      externalising, and internalising symptomatology and individual subscales 
      (withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, cognitive 
      problems, attention problems, aggressive behaviour, and rule-breaking behaviour). 
      Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was retrospectively assessed at the perinatal 
      follow-up. Poisson regression and multiple linear regression analyses were used 
      to test the association, adjusting for several family and maternal 
      sociodemographic and health factors, medication use during pregnancy, and the sex 
      of the child. RESULTS: Acetaminophen exposure during prenatal development was not 
      associated with low neurodevelopmental performance at 24 months assessed using 
      the BDI or to emotional and behavioural problems assessed at 48 months using the 
      CBCL in the adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: We cannot confirm the existence of an 
      association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and low 
      neurodevelopmental performance at 24 months and emotional/behavioural problems at 
      48 months of life based on the present results.
