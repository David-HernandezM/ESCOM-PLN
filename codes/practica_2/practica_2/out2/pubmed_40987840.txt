TI  - Cholesterol metabolic reprogramming mediates microglia-induced chronic 
      neuroinflammation and hinders neurorestoration following stroke.

AB  - Chronic neuroinflammation is a major obstacle to post-stroke recovery, yet the 
      underlying mechanisms, particularly the link between prolonged microglial 
      activation and cholesterol metabolism, are not fully known. Here we show that 
      ischaemic injury induces persistent microglial activation that perpetuates 
      chronic inflammation, leading to microglial cholesterol accumulation and 
      metabolic reprogramming. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct 
      stroke-associated foamy microglia clusters characterized by extensive 
      reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, direct intracerebral free 
      cholesterol or cholesterol crystal infusion recapitulated sustained microglial 
      activation, directly linking aberrant cholesterol metabolism to prolonged 
      neuroinflammatory responses. Therapeutically, we demonstrate that reducing 
      microglial cholesterol overload through genetic or pharmacological activation of 
      CYP46A1 in male mice promotes white matter repair and functional recovery. These 
      findings highlight microglial cholesterol metabolism as a key driver of 
      post-stroke inflammation, offering therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol 
      metabolism to mitigate long-term brain damage and promote neurorestoration, 
      potentially improving stroke-related disability outcomes.
