TI  - Next-generation T cell immunotherapies engineered with CRISPR base and prime 
      editing: challenges and opportunities.

AB  - T cells can be reprogrammed with transgenic antigen recognition receptors, 
      including chimeric antigen receptors and T cell receptors, to selectively 
      recognize and kill cancer cells. Such adoptive T cell therapies are effective in 
      patients with certain haematological cancers but challenges persist, including 
      primary and secondary resistance, a lack of efficacy in patients with solid 
      tumours, a narrow range of targetable antigens, and time-consuming and complex 
      manufacturing processes. CRISPR-based genome editing is a potent strategy to 
      enhance cellular immunotherapies. Conventional CRISPR-Cas9 systems are useful for 
      gene editing, transgene knock-in or gene knockout but can result in undesired 
      editing outcomes, including translocations and chromosomal truncations. Base 
      editing and prime editing technologies constitute a new generation of CRISPR 
      platforms and enable highly precise and programmable installation of defined 
      nucleotide variants in primary T cells. Owing to their high precision and 
      versatility, base editing and prime editing systems, hereafter collectively 
      referred to as CRISPR 2.0, are advancing to become the new standard for 
      precision-engineering of cellular immunotherapies. CRISPR 2.0 can be used to 
      augment immune cell function, broaden the spectrum of targetable antigens and 
      facilitate streamlined production of T cell therapies. Notably, CRISPR 2.0 is 
      reaching clinical maturity, with multiple clinical trials of CRISPR 2.0-modified 
      cellular therapies currently ongoing. In this Review, we discuss emerging CRISPR 
      2.0 technologies and their progress towards clinical translation, highlighting 
      challenges and opportunities, and describe strategies for the use of CRISPR 2.0 
      to advance cellular immunotherapy for haematological malignancies and solid 
      tumours in the future.
