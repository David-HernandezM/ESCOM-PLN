AB  - BACKGROUND: Fever during pregnancy is a relatively common and most often trivial 
      event. However, under specific conditions, it could affect significantly fetal 
      brain development. Few studies, with inconsistent results, investigated whether 
      fever, regardless the pathogen, could represent a risk factor for 
      neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in the offspring. We aimed to explore further 
      this question by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: 
      Peer-reviewed studies exploring the occurrence of NDD in offspring after a fetal 
      exposure to maternal fever were included. We specifically considered the impact 
      of fever severity and duration, taking into consideration some confounding 
      variables such as the use of antipyretic during pregnancy, the trimester in which 
      the fever arose, the maternal age or smoking at time of gestation. MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched without language 
      restriction. PRISMA recommendations were followed. Odds ratio (OR) were pooled 
      using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies 
      was studied using random-effects meta-regression analysis. (PROSPERO 
      CRD42020182801). RESULTS: We finally considered ten studies gathering a total of 
      10,304 children with NDD. Among them, 1394 were exposed to fever during 
      pregnancy. The selected studies were divided into 5 case-control studies and 5 
      cohort studies. Maternal exposure to fever during pregnancy increased the risk of 
      NDD in offspring with an OR of 1.24 [95% CI: 1.12-1.38]. Secondary analysis 
      revealed an increased risk for NDD when fever occurred during the first trimester 
      of gestation [OR 1.13-95% CI: 1.02-1.26]. LIMITATIONS: We excluded studies that 
      considered infections with no evidence of fever. Another potential limitation may 
      be the possible heterogeneity between study designs (cohorts and case-control). 
      CONCLUSION: Additional evidence supported the association between fever during 
      pregnancy and increased risk for NDD in offspring. Careful monitoring should be 
      considered for children born from mothers with a febrile episode during pregnancy 
      (specifically during the first trimester).
