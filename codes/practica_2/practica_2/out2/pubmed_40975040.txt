AB  - BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, highly disabling autoimmune 
      disease requiring lifelong management, yet current therapies carry substantial 
      long-term toxicity and high costs. Salvia miltiorrhiza is used clinically in the 
      treatment of RA due to its pharmacological properties such as promoting blood 
      circulation, removing blood stasis, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the 
      specific active fraction of Salvia miltiorrhiza responsible for its therapeutic 
      effect on RA and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore 
      active fraction from Salvia miltiorrhiza for the treatment of RA and elucidate 
      their underlying mechanisms. METHODS: The active fraction of Salvia miltiorrhiza 
      was screened via in vitro anti-inflammatory assay and in vivo pharmacokinetic 
      evaluation. The composition was analyzed using UHPLC-Q Exactive-MS/MS and HPLC. 
      An in vivo model of RA was established in rats using the collagen-induced 
      arthritis (CIA) method. Therapeutic effects were assessed by RT-qPCR, Western 
      Blot, and ELISA. Mechanisms were predicted via multi-omics analysis and validated 
      using Western Blot, immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR, and fluorescent probes. RESULTS: 
      One ethyl acetate extract (named ET) was identified as the active fraction from 
      Salvia miltiorrhiza. In RA rats, ET treatment significantly delayed disease 
      progression and alleviated pathological manifestations. Multi-omics analysis 
      revealed ET modulated amino acid pathways, and impacted macrophage metabolic, 
      inflammation and ferroptosis pathways. Western Blot, immunofluorescence, and 
      RT-qPCR showed that ET not only directly inhibited macrophage inflammatory 
      responses but also indirectly suppressed the activation of fibroblast-like 
      synoviocytes by regulating macrophages. At the same time, ET effectively blocks 
      the ferroptosis process by simultaneously regulating lipid peroxidation and 
      antioxidant signaling. Furthermore, ET's five principal compounds, salvianolic 
      acid B (SalB), dihydrotanshinone I (DIH), cryptotanshinone (CTS), tanshinone I 
      (TanI), and tanshinone IIA (TanIIA), demonstrated inhibitory effects on both 
      inflammation and ferroptosis. CONCLUSION: The Salvia miltiorrhiza active fraction 
      ET ameliorates RA pathology by simultaneously regulating inflammation, 
      ferroptosis, amino acid metabolism and synoviocyte dysregulation, demonstrating 
      significant therapeutic potential for RA treatment.
