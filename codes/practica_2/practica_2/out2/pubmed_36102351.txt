AB  - Although approximately 10%-15% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy 
      (IGE)/genetic generalized epilepsy remain drug-resistant, there is no consensus 
      or established concept regarding the underlying mechanisms and prevalence. This 
      review summarizes the recent data and the current hypotheses on mechanisms that 
      may contribute to drug-resistant IGE. A literature search was conducted in PubMed 
      and Embase for studies on mechanisms of drug resistance published since 1980. The 
      literature shows neither consensus on the definition nor a widely accepted model 
      to explain drug resistance in IGE or one of its subsyndromes. Large-scale genetic 
      studies have failed to identify distinct genetic causes or affected genes 
      involved in pharmacokinetics. We found clinical and experimental evidence in 
      support of four hypotheses: (1) "network hypothesis"-the degree of drug 
      resistance in IGE reflects the severity of cortical network alterations, (2) 
      "minor focal lesion in a predisposed brain hypothesis"-minor cortical lesions are 
      important for drug resistance, (3) "interneuron hypothesis"-impaired functioning 
      of γ-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons contributes to drug resistance, and (4) 
      "changes in drug kinetics"-genetically impaired kinetics of antiseizure 
      medication (ASM) reduce the effectiveness of available ASMs. In summary, the 
      exact definition and cause of drug resistance in IGE is unknown. However, 
      published evidence suggests four different mechanisms that may warrant further 
      investigation.
