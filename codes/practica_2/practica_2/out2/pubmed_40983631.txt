TI  - Induction of ferroptosis in prostate cancer by CCDC7(19-13) via TRIM21-mediated 
      ubiquitination of SLC7A11.

AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in men, with increasing 
      incidence and mortality largely attributed to treatment resistance and 
      metastasis. The effectiveness of current therapies for advanced cases is hindered 
      by intricate genetic and microenvironmental factors, emphasizing the urgent need 
      for novel therapeutic targets. Chimeric RNAs have emerged as promising biomarkers 
      in cancer research, among which CCDC7(19-13), a circular chimeric RNA, is 
      frequently identified in prostate cancer. Our study reveals that CCDC7(19-13) 
      expression is markedly reduced in advanced and recurrent prostate cancer, where 
      its low levels serve as an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Functional 
      experiments demonstrate that CCDC7(19-13) overexpression inhibits cell 
      proliferation, induces apoptosis, and suppresses tumor growth in vivo, whereas 
      its knockdown reverses these effects. Mechanistically, CCDC7(19-13) encodes a 
      novel protein, CCDC7(241aa), which triggers ferroptosis by interacting with 
      SLC7A11 and facilitating its TRIM21-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. 
      Notably, treatment with recombinant CCDC7(241aa) effectively suppresses tumor 
      growth in patient-derived xenograft models without toxicity and enhances the 
      efficacy of docetaxel and enzalutamide in vitro. These findings establish 
      CCDC7(19-13) as a significant prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target 
      in prostate cancer, with the recombinant CCDC7(241aa) protein offering promise 
      for combination therapies in advanced cases.
