TI  - Advanced lung cancer inflammation index as a new predictor for colon cancer in 
      elderly patients: an NHANES-based study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutritional and inflammatory status have both been implicated in 
      colon cancer risk. The advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) is a 
      composite prognostic index that incorporates body mass index (BMI), serum 
      albumin, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), reflecting both nutritional 
      and systemic inflammatory states. However, its role in predicting colon cancer 
      prevalence in elderly individuals remains unclear. METHODS: We used the ALI as a 
      composite marker reflecting both inflammation status and nutritional health. The 
      ALI is calculated as BMI × serum albumin/NLR, where higher values indicate better 
      nutritional status and lower systemic inflammation. To evaluate the association 
      between ALI and colon cancer prevalence, we conducted multivariate logistic 
      regression, applied an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) machine learning 
      model, and performed subgroup analyses. Additionally, a smoothed two-piece 
      logistic regression model was used to identify the ALI threshold predictive of 
      colon cancer. RESULTS: The study included 10,137 elderly participants, with a 
      colon cancer prevalence of 2.45%. The ALI was significantly lower in the colon 
      cancer group compared to those without (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic 
      regression revealed a significant inverse association between ALI and colon 
      cancer (p < 0.05), with individuals in the highest ALI tertile experiencing a 67% 
      lower risk compared to those in the lowest tertile (p for trend = 0.008). 
      Generalized additive models showed a linear relationship, identifying an 
      inflection point at 4.73 and a predictive threshold of 113.3. Sensitivity 
      analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, particularly among 
      individuals aged over 70 years, females, unmarried individuals, alcohol 
      consumers, and those with a BMI below 30. In the XGBoost model, ALI demonstrated 
      the highest predictive value for colon cancer (AUC = 0.717), outperforming 
      traditional demographic and clinical variables such as age and BMI. Furthermore, 
      ALI showed a positive association with dietary health status (p < 0.05) but was 
      not significantly related to bowel habits. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated 
      that ALI, a nutritional-inflammation prognostic index, is significantly and 
      inversely associated with the risk of colon cancer in older adults. Thus, ALI may 
      serve as a promising, non-invasive biomarker for risk stratification, 
      particularly among high-risk subgroups such as unmarried females, alcohol 
      consumers, and those with lower BMI. Its strong predictive value, confirmed by 
      machine learning, supports its potential role in personalized prevention. Further 
      studies are required to explore underlying mechanisms, including dietary and 
      microbial factors.
