AB  - Root metabolites are essential for plant development and environmental stress 
      adaptation. However, the genetic basis controlling root metabolome variation in 
      crops and its role in stress resilience remain largely uncharacterized. In this 
      study, we employed a comprehensive multi-omics approach, integrating root 
      metabolome and transcriptome profiles of 273 maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines at 
      the seedling stage. Our analysis annotated 407 metabolites, of which 155 
      exhibited significant correlations with root traits. Using a 
      variome-transcriptome-metabolome association (VTM) network, we identified the 
      glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene ZmGAD as a crucial regulator that enhances 
      root growth and stress tolerance by modulating gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) 
      biosynthesis. ZmGAD-derived GABA confers stress tolerance by regulating stomatal 
      aperture and scavenging reactive oxygen species. A transcription factor, ZmZIM2, 
      acts as a negative regulator of ZmGAD expression and GABA accumulation. Moreover, 
      a 2-bp insertion in ZmGAD causes a premature translation termination, resulting 
      in reduced GABA content, shorter roots, and decreased stress tolerance in maize. 
      The reduced frequency of a 2-bp deletion suggests it may have been inadvertently 
      lost during maize domestication and modern breeding. This study elucidates the 
      genetic and molecular framework underlying root metabolite regulation in maize 
      and provides a valuable resource for enhancing root traits and stress tolerance 
      in maize breeding.
