TI  - Relationships between Running Biomechanics, Hip Muscle Strength, and 
      Running-Related Injury in Female Collegiate Cross-country Runners.
PG  - 1053-1062
AB  - BACKGROUND: Female collegiate cross-country (XC) runners have a high incidence of 
      running-related injury (RRI). Limited reports are available that have examined 
      potential intrinsic factors that may increase RRI risk in this population. 
      PURPOSE: To examine the relationships between RRI, hip muscle strength, and lower 
      extremity running kinematics in female collegiate XC runners. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prospective observational cohort. METHODS: Participants included twenty female 
      NCAA collegiate XC runners from Southern California universities who competed in 
      the 2019-20 intercollegiate season. A pre-season questionnaire was used to gather 
      demographic information. Hip muscle strength was measured with isokinetic 
      dynamometry in a sidelying open-chain position and normalized by the runner's 
      body weight (kg). Running kinematic variables were examined using Qualisys 3D 
      Motion Capture and Visual 3D analysis. RRI occurrence was obtained via 
      post-season questionnaires. Independent t-tests were used to determine mean 
      differences between injured and non-injured runners for hip abductor muscle 
      strength and selected running kinematics. Pearson correlation coefficients were 
      calculated to examine relationships between hip muscle performance and kinematic 
      variables. RESULTS: End-of-the-season RRI information was gathered from 19 of the 
      20 participants. During the 2019-20 XC season, 57.9% (11 of 19) of the runners 
      sustained an RRI. There were no significant differences between mean hip abductor 
      normalized muscle strength (p=0.76) or mean normalized hip muscle strength 
      asymmetry (p=0.18) of injured and non-injured runners during the XC season. 
      Similarly, no significant differences were found between mean values of selected 
      kinematic variables of runners who did and who did not report an RRI. Moderate 
      relationships were found between hip abductor strength variables and right knee 
      adduction at footstrike (r=0.50), maximum right knee adduction during stance 
      (r=0.55), left supination at footstrike (r=0.48), right peak pronation during 
      stance (r=-0.47), left supination at footstrike (r=0.51), and right peak 
      pronation during stance (r=-0.54) (all pâ‰¤0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hip abduction muscle 
      strength, hip abduction strength asymmetry, and selected running kinematic 
      variables were not associated with elevated risk of RRI in female collegiate XC 
      runners.
