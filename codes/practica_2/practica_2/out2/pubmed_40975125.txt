AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood vessels are continuously exposed to mechanical forces, mainly 
      including shear stress, cyclic stretch, and hydrostatic pressure. These forces 
      regulate the functions of endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle 
      cells (VSMCs) through complex mechanosensing and signal transduction pathways, 
      which are essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, under 
      pathological conditions, they can contribute to the development of vascular 
      diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and aortic aneurysm. AIM OF 
      REVIEW: This review aims to synthesize the mechanosensors and downstream 
      signaling pathways of vascular mechanical forces in ECs and VSMCs, emphasizing 
      their effects on cell behaviors and their involvement in the onset and 
      progression of atherosclerosis, hypertension and aortic aneurysms. KEY SCIENTIFIC 
      CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Multiple molecules and structures - including ion channels, 
      G-protein coupled receptors, cellular junction molecules, and other membrane 
      structures - act as mechanosensors of vascular mechanical forces and trigger 
      multiple downstream signal transduction pathways. The pathological alterations in 
      shear stress, cyclic stretch, and hydrostatic pressure regulate the functions and 
      behaviors of ECs and VSMCs, including cellular proliferation, migration, 
      apoptosis, oxidative stress, endothelial permeability, etc. These responses 
      induce vascular inflammation, dysfunction and remodeling, which eventually 
      contributes to the onset and progression of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and 
      aortic aneurysms. This review also highlights the underestimated role of 
      hydrostatic pressure in atherosclerosis and hypertension, as well as other 
      research gaps and future directions for vascular mechanical forces research. 
      Understanding and therapeutically modulating these biomechanical pathways may 
      ultimately facilitate more effective prevention and treatment of vascular 
      diseases.
