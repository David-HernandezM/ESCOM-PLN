AB  - We have shown that the ligand-responsive MarR family member SlyA plays an 
      important role in transcription activation of multiple virulence genes in 
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium by responding to guanosine tetraphosphate 
      (ppGpp). Here, we demonstrate that another MarR family member, EmrR, is required 
      for virulence of S. Typhimurium and another enteric bacterium, Yersinia pestis 
      EmrR is found to activate transcription of an array of virulence determinants, 
      including Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes and several divergent 
      operons, which have been shown to be activated by SlyA and the PhoP/PhoQ 
      two-component system. We studied the regulatory effect of EmrR on one of these 
      genetic loci, i.e., the pagC-pagD divergent operon, and characterized a 
      catecholamine neurotransmitter, dopamine, as an EmrR-sensed signal. Dopamine acts 
      on EmrR to reduce its ability to bind to the target promoters, thus functioning 
      as a negative signal to downregulate this EmrR-activated transcription. EmrR can 
      bind to AT-rich sequences, which particularly overlap the SlyA and PhoP binding 
      sites in the pagC-pagD divergent promoter. EmrR is a priming transcription 
      regulator that binds its target promoters prior to successive transcription 
      activators, by which it displaces universal silencer H-NS from these promoters 
      and facilitates successive regulators to bind these regions. Regulation of the 
      Salmonella-specific gene in Escherichia coli and Y. pestis reveals that 
      EmrR-dependent regulation is conserved in enteric bacteria. These observations 
      suggest that EmrR is a transcription activator to control the expression of 
      virulence genes, including the SPI-2 genes. Dopamine can act on the EmrR-mediated 
      signal transduction, thus downregulating expression of these virulence 
      factors.IMPORTANCE In this study, MarR family regulator EmrR is identified as a 
      novel virulence factor of enteric bacteria, here exemplified by Salmonella 
      enterica serovar Typhimurium and Yersinia pestis EmrR exerts an essential effect 
      as a transcription activator for expression of virulence determinants, including 
      Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 genes and a set of horizontally acquired 
      genetic loci that formed divergent operons. EmrR senses the neurotransmitter 
      dopamine and is subsequently released from target promoters, resulting in 
      downregulation of the virulence gene expression. Through this action on EmrR, 
      dopamine can weaken Salmonella resistance against host defense mechanisms. This 
      provides an explanation for the previous observation that dopamine inhibits 
      bacterial infection in animal gastrointestinal tracts. Our findings provide 
      evidence that this neurotransmitter can modulate bacterial gene expression 
      through interaction with virulence regulator EmrR.
