TI  - Comparative single-cell and spatial profiling of anti-SSA-positive and 
      anti-centromere-positive Sjögren's disease reveals common and distinct immune 
      activation and fibroblast-mediated inflammation.

AB  - Sjögren's disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease that causes salivary gland 
      dysfunction due to immune-mediated destruction. While autoantibodies such as 
      anti-SSA and anti-centromere (CENT) are associated with distinct clinical 
      manifestations, the molecular features remain to be elucidated. In this study, we 
      apply multi-modal single-cell technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell 
      and B cell receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to salivary gland 
      lesions, aiming to elucidate common and unique cellular and transcriptional 
      signatures linked to different autoantibody profiles. Our analysis demonstrates 
      that GZMB(+)GNLY(+) CD8(+) T cells are the main expanded subset across different 
      autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SjD pathogenesis, while 
      the enrichment of memory B cells is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive 
      patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an 
      activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ 
      signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial 
      profiling reveals THY1(+) fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and 
      chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands. 
      These findings deepen our understanding of the pathogenesis of SjD, and may 
      inform the development of targeted and personalized therapeutic strategies.
