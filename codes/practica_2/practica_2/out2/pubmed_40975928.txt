AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly recognized as complex disorders 
      involving multiple protein pathologies, with α-synuclein frequently observed 
      beyond classical synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple 
      system atrophy. Recent advances in seed amplification assays (SAAs) have enabled 
      the highly sensitive and specific detection of misfolded α-synuclein in vivo, 
      particularly in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This review focuses on CSF-based 
      α-synuclein SAAs and their application in detecting co-pathology across 
      non-synucleinopathies, including Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear 
      palsy, corticobasal syndrome, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 
      traumatic brain injury. Evidence indicates a role for α-synuclein in clinical 
      heterogeneity and disease progression. Emerging diagnostic frameworks 
      increasingly support integrating co-pathologies into classification and 
      therapeutic strategies. Addressing key knowledge gaps, such as α-synuclein 
      interactions with other protein pathologies, and current limitations of α-syn 
      SAA, such as the lack of quantification of misfolded α-synuclein seeds, will 
      refine precision medicine and improve outcomes for patients with 
      neurodegenerative diseases.
