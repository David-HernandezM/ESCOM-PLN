AB  - Current kidney organoids do not recapitulate the kidney's complex spatial 
      patterning and function, limiting their applications. The human kidney comprises 
      one million nephrons, derived from nephron progenitor cells, that connect to an 
      arborized ureteric progenitor cell-derived collecting system. Here, we develop 
      spatially organized mouse and human kidney progenitor assembloid (KPA) models in 
      which the nephrons undergo extensive development and fuse to a centrally located 
      collecting system, recapitulating kidney progenitor self-assembly processes 
      observed in vivo. KPAs show dramatically improved cellular complexity and 
      maturity and exhibit several aspects of major kidney functions in vitro and in 
      vivo. Modeling human autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) with 
      genome-edited, in vivo-grown human KPAs recapitulated the cystic phenotype and 
      the molecular and cellular hallmarks of the disease and highlighted the crosstalk 
      among cyst epithelium, stroma, and macrophages. The KPA platform opens new 
      avenues for high-fidelity disease modeling and lays a strong foundation for 
      kidney regenerative medicine.
