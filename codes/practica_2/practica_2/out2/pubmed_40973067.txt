AB  - IntroductionImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have redefined cancer 
      therapeutics. However, they may provoke immune-related adverse events (irAEs), 
      with diabetes potentially altering their patterns. We aimed to investigate 
      whether diabetic cancer patients exhibit a distinctive or intensified irAE 
      pattern.MethodsWe performed a real-world, retrospective pharmacovigilance study 
      of ICIs using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System from 2011 to 2025. Reports 
      listing anti-PD-1 (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Cemiplimab), anti-PD-L1 
      (Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab, Tremelimumab) 
      agents as suspected drugs were extracted. Disproportionality signals were 
      identified with 4 algorithms: Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network, 
      Reporting Odds Ratio, Proportional Reporting Ratio, and Multi-item Gamma Poisson 
      Shrinker. Time-to-onset was calculated from therapy start to event date, modelled 
      with Weibull distributions, and compared across subgroups with non-parametric 
      tests.ResultsOf 22,775,812 FAERS reports, 1886 involved ICIs used in cancer 
      patients with comorbid diabetes. 423 (22.4 %) were fatal and 1463 (77.6 %) 
      non-fatal. Men predominated (71.5 %), and 63.0 % of patients were aged 
      65-85 years. Combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4 plus PD-1 or PD-L1) accounted for 
      the highest death proportion (29.6 %). Disproportionality analysis revealed the 
      strongest preferred-term signals for pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease, 
      hypothyroidism, and colitis among all diabetic cancer patients receiving ICI 
      therapy. At the system-organ-class level, endocrine, hepatobiliary, and 
      blood/lymphatic disorders showed the most consistent risk across agents. Weibull 
      modelling demonstrated an early-failure pattern (shape β < 1) with a median 
      time-to-onset of 126.6 days overall, shortening to 90.9 days with combination 
      therapy. Fatal subgroup occurred sooner than non-fatal subgroup (median 106.7 vs 
      132.5 days; P = 0.004).ConclusionDiabetic cancer patients experienced the full 
      spectrum of ICI-associated toxicities, with combination treatments linked to 
      greater lethality. Multidisciplinary surveillance during the first 3-4 months of 
      therapy, glycemic control, and long-term follow-up may be essential to optimize 
      benefit and minimize harm in this expanding population.

OAB - Why was the study done?Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are effective cancer 
      treatments but can trigger serious immune-related side effects. Diabetes is very 
      common among cancer patients and may increase vulnerability to these side 
      effects, but little is known about how ICIs affect this group. We wanted to 
      understand whether patients with both cancer and diabetes experience different or 
      more severe side effects when treated with ICIs.What did the researchers do?We 
      analyzed more than 22 million reports of drug side effects in the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration’s database between 2011 and 2025. From these, we identified 
      nearly 1900 reports involving cancer patients with diabetes who were treated with 
      ICIs. We studied the types of side effects, how quickly they occurred, and how 
      they differed between patients receiving single drugs vs combination 
      treatments.What did the researchers find?The most common serious side effects in 
      diabetic patients included lung inflammation (pneumonitis), thyroid problems, and 
      bowel inflammation (colitis). Patients receiving 2 ICIs in combination developed 
      side effects earlier and were more likely to die from them than those receiving 
      single drugs. More than half of patients needed hospitalization, and about 1 in 5 
      cases reported in the database were fatal. Overall, diabetic patients experienced 
      the same range of side effects as other patients, but serious events occurred 
      sooner.What do the findings mean?These results suggest that cancer patients with 
      diabetes need especially close monitoring when treated with ICIs, particularly in 
      the first 3-4 months of therapy and when receiving combination immunotherapy. 
      Regular checks of blood sugar, thyroid and liver function, and attention to lung 
      and digestive symptoms are essential. Involving diabetes specialists early may 
      help prevent complications. As more people worldwide are living with both cancer 
      and diabetes, our findings highlight the importance of tailored care strategies 
      to ensure patients benefit from immunotherapy while staying safe.
