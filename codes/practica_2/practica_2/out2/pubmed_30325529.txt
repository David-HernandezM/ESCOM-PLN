AB  - AIM: We examined the long-term outcomes and safety of early intravenous 
      paracetamol for ductus arteriosus closure at a corrected age of two years. 
      METHODS: This was a follow-up of the 2013-2014 randomised, double-blind Preterm 
      Infant's Paracetamol Study at Oulu University Hospital, Finland, which recruited 
      48 very preterm infants within 24 hours of birth. They received intravenous 
      paracetamol or a placebo for four days. In 2015-2017, we followed up 44 infants 
      (92%) at two years of corrected age. This included clinical and 
      neurodevelopmental assessments and a parental medical history questionnaire. 
      RESULTS: The 44 infants (55% boys) were born at 23(5) -31(6) weeks of gestation. 
      No differences in the cardiac parameters, including blood pressures and 
      ultrasound scan results, were found. Neurodevelopmental stages, as quantified by 
      the Griffiths test, were similar. No signs of autism were reported. Asthma 
      medication was more common in the control group, but the difference was not 
      significant. Atopy scores, numbers of infections and the use of public health 
      services were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION: No long-term adverse 
      reactions of early intravenous paracetamol were detected two years later. Larger 
      trials are needed on the safety and efficacy of paracetamol prophylaxis for early 
      ductal closure in very preterm infants.
