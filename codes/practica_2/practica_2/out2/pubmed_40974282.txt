AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic oral inflammatory disease characterized by alveolar 
      bone loss. Other diseases, such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and 
      diabetes, can exacerbate its progression. These chronic diseases also have 
      systemic effects that vary in frequency in men and women. Thus, this study sought 
      to determine if periodontitis induced sex-specific changes in long bones. 
      Periodontitis was induced by tying a 5-0 silk suture around the second maxillary 
      molar of 6- to 8-wk-old male and female C57BL/6J mice. Ligatures were left in 
      place for 7 d or 21 d, and the tibia was subsequently collected for 
      characterization using micro-computed tomography, flow cytometry, and proteomics 
      analysis. Female mice exhibited sustained trabecular and cortical bone loss 
      through day 21, whereas males recovered from any bone loss observed at day 7. 
      Flow cytometry and proteomics analysis indicated that an increased neutrophil 
      response contributes to this bone loss by upregulating pathways associated with 
      neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and reactive oxygen species 
      production. Eliminating NET generation using a Padi4-deficient mouse eliminated 
      the bone loss phenotype during periodontitis. This study suggests that the 
      neutrophil-driven pattern of bone loss observed in female mice, as well as the 
      higher prevalence of osteoporosis in women, may highlight a potential mechanism 
      by which periodontitis exacerbates systemic bone loss.
