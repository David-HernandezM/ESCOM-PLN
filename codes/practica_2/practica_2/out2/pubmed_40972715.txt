AB  - Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) plays a significant role in modulating immune 
      responses, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. SDF enhances 
      intestinal barrier integrity and regulates immune function by modulating the 
      composition of the gut microbiota and increasing the production of beneficial 
      microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), 
      3-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, and bile acids. Current evidence 
      suggests that SDF holds therapeutic potential in managing chronic inflammatory 
      diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome 
      (IBS), and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Despite these 
      promising findings, the mechanisms by which SDF exerts its effects, particularly 
      in distal organs and neuroinflammatory conditions, remain poorly understood. This 
      review explores the mechanistic pathways by which SDF modulates immune regulation 
      and highlights the current challenges and future strategies for optimizing its 
      clinical application in treating inflammatory diseases.
