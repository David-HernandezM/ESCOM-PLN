AB  - BACKGROUND: T cells are pivotal in mediating antitumor immunity in lung 
      adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In this study, we aimed to profile T cell-related gene 
      (TRG) expression and develop a prognostic indicator to identify patients with 
      LUAD who may derive greater benefit from immunotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Transcriptomic and clinical data of patients with LUAD were sourced from The 
      Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. The prognostic 
      relevance of tumor-infiltrating T cells was assessed, and TRGs were further 
      pinpointed through single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis. Weighted gene 
      coexpression network analysis identified LUAD-specific modules. A T cell-related 
      gene prognostic indicator (TRGPI) was subsequently developed using a machine 
      learning framework, with the RSF + Ridge model chosen on the basis of 
      cross-cohort performance. We further employed spatial transcriptomics to evaluate 
      the most impactful prognostic TRG, providing spatial context to its expression 
      patterns. RESULTS: Increased T cell infiltration correlated with improved 
      survival outcomes in LUAD. The TRGPI, derived from both scRNA-seq and bulk 
      transcriptomic data, demonstrated robust prognostic and predictive capabilities 
      across multiple cohorts. Patients with a low TRGPI exhibited enhanced overall 
      survival, more active immune and antibacterial pathways, a higher tumor mutation 
      burden, and more favorable predicted responses to immunotherapy. TPI1 was 
      identified as the most impactful prognostic TRG, and spatial transcriptomics 
      analysis and functional assays further established the oncogenic role of TPI1 in 
      LUAD. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a novel, robust TRGPI that accurately 
      predicts patient prognosis and immunotherapy responses in LUAD, providing a 
      valuable tool for precision medicine and personalized treatment strategies.
