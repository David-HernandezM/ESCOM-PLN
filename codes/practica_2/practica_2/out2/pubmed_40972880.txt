AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: MASLD is defined by abnormalities in cardiometabolic risk 
      factors (CMRFs). Characterizing the contribution of individual CMRFs to clinical 
      outcomes may guide prioritization of interventions. We evaluated the association 
      of individual CMRFs with all-cause mortality in US adults with metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). METHODS: Participants in 
      the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1994) and 
      continuous NHANES (1999-2018) were linked to mortality data through 2019. Adults 
      > 20 years of age were included if Fatty Liver Index (FLI) > 60 and at least one 
      CMRF (overweight/obesity, glucose intolerance, high blood pressure, 
      triglycerides, or low high-density lipoprotein [HDL]). Cox regression analyzed 
      risk of all-cause mortality adjusted for age, sex, and FIB-4. RESULTS: Among 
      21,872 participants included (mean age 50 years, 53% male), mean BMI was 33.6 
      kg/m(2) with a median of 3 CMRF (99.5% overweight/obese, 55% glucose intolerance, 
      58% high blood pressure, 67% triglycerides, 40% low HDL). In adjusted analysis of 
      individual CMRF, high blood pressure (aHR 1.39, 95%CI 1.24-1.55, p<0.001), 
      glucose intolerance (aHR 1.26, 95%CI 1.16-1.38, p<0.01), and low HDL (aHR 1.15, 
      95%CI 1.05-1.26, p=0.003) exerted significant risks for mortality. When 
      stratifying the overweight/obesity CMRF by discrete BMI ranges, a significantly 
      greater risk for mortality was seen with BMI 35 - 40 kg/m(2) (aHR 1.18, 95%CI 
      1.02-1.36, p=0.03), BMI 40 - 45 kg/m(2) (aHR 1.55, 95%CI 1.24-1.94, p<0.001), BMI 
      > 45 kg/m(2) (aHR 1.64, 95%CI 1.27-2.14, p<0.001) compared to those with a BMI 25 
      - 30 kg/m(2). In age-adjusted analysis, number of CMRFs was associated with 
      greater risk for mortality (aHR 1.15 per additional CMRF, 95%CI 1.10-1.20, 
      p<0.001) CONCLUSIONS: The differential risk for mortality between individual 
      CMRFs supports distinct clinical profiles in MASLD. This study found that high 
      blood pressure and glucose intolerance exerted the greatest risk for all-cause 
      mortality in those with MASLD, suggesting a role for prioritization of CMRF 
      optimization.
