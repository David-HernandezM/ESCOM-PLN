AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity and mechanism of cinnamon 
      essential oil nanoemulsion (CON) against Pseudomonas deceptionensis CM2. The 
      results revealed that CON could effectively inhibit the proliferation of P. 
      deceptionensis CM2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After 4 h 
      of incubation with CON at the minimum inhibitory concentration (0.125 mg/mL), the 
      relative fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide and 1-N-phenylnapthylamine 
      (NPN) was increased by 32.0% and 351.4%, respectively. The membrane permeability 
      of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells was significantly disrupted after CON treatment, 
      resulting in the leakage of intracellular substances (such as proteins and 
      electrolytes). CON also caused significant increases in the DiBAC(4)(3) 
      fluorescence intensity of P. deceptionensis CM2 cells. These results demonstrate 
      that CON induced inactivation of P. deceptionensis CM2 by destroying the 
      integrity and function of bacterial membrane. A higher level of intracellular 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed in CON-treated cells (p < 0.05), 
      compared with control cells. Moreover, the addition of glutathione to the growth 
      medium remarkably decreased the antimicrobial activity of CON against P. 
      deceptionensis CM2, further confirming that oxidative stress played an important 
      role in the antimicrobial activity of CON. Overall, CON may exhibit antibacterial 
      effects by causing damage to the bacterial membranes and oxidative stress.
