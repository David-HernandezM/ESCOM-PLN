AB  - Although cadmium (Cd) exposure has been implicated in lung cancer development, 
      systematic investigations into its association with cancer mortality, 
      particularly lung cancer mortality remain limited, and the molecular mechanisms 
      driving Cd-induced tumor progression are not fully understood. In this study, we 
      first conducted a meta-analysis of existing cohort studies to quantitatively 
      assess the association between Cd exposure and cancer- and lung cancer-specific 
      mortality. We then employed an integrative approach combining bioinformatics 
      analyses, LASSO regression, and Mendelian randomization to identify and validate 
      DHX34 as a key gene implicated in Cd-related lung carcinogenesis. These findings 
      were further supported by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, in 
      vitro functional assays, and in vivo tumor models. Our meta-analysis showed that 
      long-term Cd exposure significantly increased cancer mortality risk, especially 
      in males (RR = 1.49, 95 % CI: 1.13-1.96) and in lung cancer (RR = 1.86, 95 % CI: 
      1.36-2.54). Integration of GSE165549 and TCGA data identified 36 Cd-related genes 
      enriched in tumor associated pathways including cell cycle and DNA replication. 
      LASSO regression and Mendelian randomization suggested a causal role of DHX34 in 
      lung cancer. Molecular docking demonstrated a strong binding affinity between 
      Cd(2 +) and DHX34 (binding free energy = -5.34 kcal/mol), and molecular dynamics 
      simulations confirmed the stability of this complex. Functional assays further 
      showed that CdCl(2) exposure upregulated DHX34, thereby promoting lung cancer 
      cell proliferation and tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these 
      findings provide multi-level evidence that DHX34 mediates Cd-induced lung cancer 
      progression, highlighting the carcinogenic potential of environmental heavy metal 
      exposure and offering new insights into molecular targets for early prevention, 
      risk stratification, and therapeutic intervention.
