AB  - This review briefly covers periods of my early life; experiences during World War 
      II; my school education; and my period as a medical student in Bonn, Hamburg, and 
      D端sseldorf. Mainly emphasized is my scientific career after finishing my medical 
      internship and periods as a postdoc at the Institute for Microbiology in 
      D端sseldorf and the Virus Laboratories of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia 
      and as Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Virology in W端rzburg, Germany. 
      Subsequent appointment as chairman of the newly established Institute of 
      Virology, University of Erlangen-N端rnberg, in a similar position at the 
      University of Freiburg, and then for 20 years as scientific director of the 
      Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, are discussed, covering the 
      scientific developments during these periods. The emeritus period since 2003 was 
      particularly exciting, leading to the discovery of autonomously replicating 
      plasmids, derived from specific bacteria, and their link to common human cancers 
      (colon, breast, and prostate).
