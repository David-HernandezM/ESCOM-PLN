AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle interventions for weight loss might exacerbate age-related 
      bone loss and osteoporosis. However, there is limited knowledge about their 
      effects on bone quality. We examined whether lifestyle intervention can preserve 
      or enhance bone quality, despite reductions in bone mineral density. METHODS: The 
      Lifestyle Intervention to Improve Bone Quality (LIMB-Q) study was a randomised 
      controlled trial conducted at Baylor College of Medicine and the Michael E 
      DeBakey VA Medical Center (Houston, TX, USA) including older adults (aged 65-85 
      years) with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m(2)). Participants were randomly assigned to 
      receive either an intensive lifestyle intervention (intensive lifestyle group, 
      consisting of weight management plus exercise training) or healthy lifestyle 
      (healthy lifestyle group, consisting of educational sessions on healthy diets). 
      The co-primary outcomes were 12-month changes in (1) distal tibia cortical 
      thickness, measured using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT, and (2) hip 
      bone strength (failure load), assessed via finite element analysis of CT scans. 
      The primary endpoint was analysed by intention to treat (all randomly assigned 
      patients). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03329963 
      (completed). FINDINGS: Of 138 participants assessed for eligibility in person 
      between Nov 9, 2017, and Nov 8, 2021, 120 were included in this study (mean age 
      71·4 years [SD 4·6]; 63 [53%] male and 57 [47%] female). At 12 months, weight 
      loss was greater in the intensive lifestyle group than in the healthy lifestyle 
      group (-11·6 kg [SE 0·5] vs -1·2 kg [0·5]). No group differences were noted in 
      the change in distal tibia cortical thickness between the intensive lifestyle 
      group (-0·013 mm [SE 0·026]) and the healthy lifestyle group (-0·002 mm [0·025]; 
      between-group difference 0·027 [95% CI -0·066 to 0·120], p=0·40). The change in 
      hip failure load at 12 months did not differ between the intensive lifestyle 
      group (13 N [SE 25]) and the healthy lifestyle group (3 N [26]; between-group 
      difference -6.9 N [95% CI -108 to 95], p=0·89). Exercise-related adverse events 
      in the intensive lifestyle group included a small number of musculoskeletal 
      events (falls [one participant], neck pain [two], and foot, shoulder, back, and 
      leg pain [one each]). INTERPRETATION: Lifestyle intervention preserved bone 
      quality in older adults with obesity during weight loss. Further research is 
      needed to determine whether lifestyle interventions can reduce fracture risk in 
      older adults with obesity. FUNDING: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
