TI  - Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the 
      development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring 
      may be due to bias. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the role of 
      potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between 
      acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. 
      The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure 
      misclassification. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the 
      Cochrane Library up to December 2018. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: We 
      included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen 
      use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. SYNTHESIS: We meta-analysed data 
      across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to 
      studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic 
      errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure 
      misclassification. RESULTS: The search resulted in seven studies included in our 
      meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk 
      ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I(2) 
       = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis 
      showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the 
      proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding 
      bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and 
      increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be 
      confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) 
      were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; 
      RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and 
      RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. CONCLUSIONS: Bias analysis suggests that the previously 
      reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased 
      risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability 
      to conclude a causal association is limited.
