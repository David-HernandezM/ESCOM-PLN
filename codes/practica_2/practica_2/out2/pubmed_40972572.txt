AB  - Tumor heterogeneity fueled by plasticity of cancer cells is a key to therapy 
      failure. Here, we define the role of proximal communications of malignant cells 
      in glioblastoma plasticity. We find that tumor cell state coherence is maximal in 
      cells organized in homotypic clusters with defined relationships with 
      non-malignant cells, whereas randomly dispersed cells downregulate the original 
      state, acquire alternative phenotypes and exhibit changes in the 
      microenvironment. We demonstrate the intrinsic propensity of glioblastoma cells 
      to develop into clustered and dispersed spatial patterns in orthotopic mouse 
      models and experimentally validate the cell state-specific mechanisms of 
      cell-cell adhesion that prevent phenotype deviation with pharmacologic 
      perturbations in patients-derived glioblastoma models. We establish the 
      generality of "homotypic clustered cell identity" in circulating clustered and 
      single breast cancer cells and show that the glioblastoma 
      glycolytic-plurimetabolic dispersed cellular state uniquely confers shorter 
      survival, thus assigning clinical significance to the spatial patterning of 
      cancer cells in human tumors.
