AB  - The constructed theory of forensic nursing care is a middle-range nursing theory 
      developed from the integrated practice model for forensic nursing science, a 
      conceptual framework. Theory evolution was achieved following a critique of the 
      conceptual framework and through inductive and deductive reasoning. A review of 
      nursing theory growth and significance of middle-range theories is presented as 
      background information in understanding the importance of this emerging forensic 
      nursing middle-range theory. The philosophical and theoretical foundations of 
      forensic nursing are bolstered with the addition of three nursing theories, two 
      healthcare models and one social theory. Links are made between theory components 
      and the current state of forensic nursing. Assumptions and concepts are clearly 
      defined. The middle-range theory provides three testable propositions to frame 
      forensic nursing practice, education, and research. Research conducted on the 
      propositions will expand the forensic nursing scientific base leading to enhanced 
      evidence-based practice. A pictorial model illustrates the propositions as 
      relational statements. The constructed theory of forensic nursing care affirms 
      the focus of forensic nursing care is on the nurse-patient relationship and 
      improved health outcomes. Additional results of forensic nursing care are 
      improved forensic science and criminal justice system outcomes.
