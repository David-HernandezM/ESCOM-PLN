AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently develops resistance to CD8+ T 
      cell-based immunotherapy, yet the mechanisms driving this immune evasion remain 
      poorly understood. To identify tumor-intrinsic regulators of immunotherapy 
      resistance and explore therapeutic strategies to restore T cell-mediated tumor 
      control, we employed three functional genomics approaches using in vitro and in 
      vivo CRISPR screening. Cancer USP14 was identified as the critical immune evasion 
      driver. USP14-high HCC patients exhibited poorer anti-PD1 antibody therapy 
      responses and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Inhibition of USP14 suppressed 
      HCC cell growth in coculture with activated CD8+ T cells and restored cocultured 
      CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo USP14 targeting synergized with anti-PD1 
      antibody therapy. Mechanistically, USP14 deubiquitinated and stabilized GLUT1 
      through the removal of Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains at Lys-245, which enabled 
      HCC cells to outcompete CD8+ T cells for glucose, generating a glucose-deprived 
      tumor microenvironment that suppressed CD8+ T cell function. Our findings show 
      USP14 in cancer has a proimmunoevasive role in CD8+ T cell-based tumor immunity 
      through GLUT1-mediated glucose competition. These findings position USP14 
      inhibitors as promising adjuvants to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC, 
      providing actionable insights for overcoming resistance.
