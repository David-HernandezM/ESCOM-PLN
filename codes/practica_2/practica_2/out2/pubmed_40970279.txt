TI  - Fibroblast-Specific Loss of TGF-β Signaling Mediates Lipomatous Metaplasia in the 
      Infarcted Heart.
LID - 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.125.075676 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients surviving myocardial infarction, adipose tissue 
      infiltration within the scar is a common pathological finding and has been 
      suggested to contribute to dysfunction and arrhythmogenesis. However, the 
      cellular mechanisms for lipomatous metaplasia after infarction remain enigmatic. 
      Our study reveals a novel molecular mechanism that mediates 
      fibroblast-to-adipocyte conversion and causes fatty infiltration in the infarcted 
      heart. METHODS: Mice with fibroblast-specific disruption of TGF-β (transforming 
      growth factor β) or Smad-dependent signaling and corresponding controls were 
      generated and underwent reperfusion and nonreperfusion myocardial infarction 
      protocols. Echocardiography, histological studies, and transcriptomic analysis 
      were used to study effects on cardiac repair and remodeling. Lineage tracing 
      experiments were used to document fibroblast-to-adipocyte conversion. In vitro, 
      the effects of genetic disruption or pharmacological blockade of TGF-β signaling 
      on mouse cardiac fibroblasts were examined. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from 
      human patients with myocardial infarction were analyzed to assess 
      fibroblast-to-adipocyte conversion. RESULTS: Fibroblast-specific abrogation of 
      TGF-β signaling through deletion of TbR2 (type 2 TGF-β receptor) increased the 
      incidence of early postinfarction cardiac rupture, promoting a matrix-degrading 
      fibroblast phenotype. Moreover, fibroblast-specific TbR2 loss resulted in 
      replacement of 30% to 40% of the mature scar with adipocytes in both reperfused 
      and nonreperfused infarcts. Lineage tracing demonstrated that fibroblast-specific 
      TbR2 loss promotes fibroblast-to-adipocyte conversion through effects that 
      involve Smad-independent cascades. In vitro, TbR2 inhibition induced expression 
      of adipogenesis-associated genes in primary cardiac fibroblasts. Genetic TbR2 
      loss promoted conversion of infarct fibroblasts to adipocytes upon stimulation 
      with adipogenic medium. A subpopulation of fibroblasts in human fibrotic 
      infarcted hearts acquired expression of adipocyte genes. CONCLUSIONS: TGF-β 
      signaling plays a central role in maintaining fibroblast cell specification after 
      cardiac injury. Fibroblast-to-adipocyte conversion induced by disrupted TGF-β 
      signaling may underlie scar-associated lipomatous metaplasia and may play an 
      important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure and arrhythmogenesis in 
      patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
