AB  - INTRODUCTION: The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) plasma biomarkers is poorly understood. We tested whether kidney function 
      decline affects the predictive accuracy of plasma biomarkers on 
      neuropsychological or neuroimaging outcomes. METHODS: Three hundred thirty-three 
      non-demented older adults were included. Linear regressions related plasma glial 
      fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid beta 42, and 
      phosphorylated tau(231), with a blood-based biomarker x estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate (eGFR) interaction term, to cross-sectional and longitudinal 
      (mean follow-up time = 6.4 ± 2.8 years) neuropsychological and neuroimaging 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Plasma NfL interacted with eGFR on the longitudinal trajectory 
      of nearly all neuropsychological outcomes (p values < 0.02) and several 
      neuroimaging outcomes (p values < 0.02). Associations were stronger in 
      individuals with no CKD/stage 1 and stage 2 CKD, while associations were weaker 
      or not significant in individuals with stage 3 CKD. DISCUSSION: Among older 
      adults free of severe CKD, the ability of plasma NfL to predict key AD-related 
      biomarker outcomes was moderated by renal function. HIGHLIGHTS: Reduced kidney 
      function was associated with increased blood biomarker levels. The predictive 
      accuracy of neurofilament light chain was reduced in participants with kidney 
      dysfunction. Even mild kidney dysfunction can affect blood biomarkers of 
      Alzheimer's disease.
