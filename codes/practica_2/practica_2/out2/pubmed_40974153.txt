AB  - Early pathogen clearance and immunomodulation are critical for the restoration of 
      infected bone defects. Conventional osteoimmunomodulatory strategies mainly 
      emphasize M2 macrophage-mediated bone regeneration, neglecting the pivotal role 
      of early-stage M1 macrophage-activated immune response in microbial elimination. 
      This oversight ultimately compromises repair efficacy in infected bone defects. 
      Herein, a temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to regulate the 
      immune-osteogenic microenvironment for the repair of infected bone defects. The 
      hydrogel is rapidly formed by crosslinking of acrylate-modified engineered 
      protein with oxidized sodium alginate, mimicking extracellular matrix 
      architecture to promote cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. To achieve 
      temporal ion release, zinc-based nanoparticles mineralized with hydroxyapatite 
      are incorporated within the hydrogel matrix. The early-stage release of Ca(2+) 
      promotes M1 polarization to inhibit infection, while sustained release of Zn(2+) 
      induces M2 polarization to promote osteogenic differentiation. This system 
      further exhibits antioxidant and antibacterial properties, ensuring comprehensive 
      immunomodulation across the bone healing process. In a rat model of infected 
      cranial defects, the hydrogel effectively remodels the osteoimmune 
      microenvironment, suppresses infection, and facilitates vascularized bone 
      regeneration. This work highlights a temporal immunomodulatory strategy for 
      infected bone repair and offers new insights into the design of advanced 
      osteoimmunomodulatory biomaterials.
