AB  - OBJECTIVE: Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is an adverse event that occurs during 
      long-term peritoneal dialysis, significantly impairing treatment efficiency and 
      adversely affecting patient outcomes. Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), a principal 
      active component derived from Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge, has 
      exhibited anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in various settings. This 
      study aims to investigate the potential therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of 
      AS-IV in the treatment of PF. METHODS: The PF mouse model was established by 
      intraperitoneal injection of 4.25% peritoneal dialysis fluid (100 mL/kg). The 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of HMrSV5 cells was induced by the 
      addition of 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). The differentially 
      expressed genes in HMrSV5 cells treated with AS-IV were screened using 
      transcriptome sequencing analysis. The potential targets of AS-IV were screened 
      using network pharmacology and analyzed using molecular docking and molecular 
      dynamics simulations. RESULTS: Administration of AS-IV at doses of 20, 40, or 
      80 mg/kg effectively mitigated the increase in peritoneal thickness and the 
      development of fibrosis in mice with PF. The expression of the fibrosis marker 
      α-smooth muscle actin in the peritoneum was significantly decreased in 
      AS-IV-treated mice. The treatment of AS-IV at concentrations of 10, 20, and 
      40 μmol/L significantly delayed the EMT of HMrSV5 cells induced by TGF-β, as 
      demonstrated by the decreased number of 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells, 
      reduced migrated area, and decreased expression of fibrosis markers. A total of 
      460 differentially expressed genes were detected in AS-IV-treated HMrSV5 cells 
      through transcriptome sequencing, with notable enrichment in the 
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT serine/threonine kinase 
      1 (AKT) signaling pathway. The reduced levels of phosphorylated PI3K (p-PI3K) and 
      p-AKT were detected in HMrSV5 cells with AS-IV treatment. Epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) was predicted as a direct target of AS-IV, exhibiting strong 
      hydrogen bond interactions. The activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway by the 
      compound 740Y-P, and the activation of the EGFR pathway by NSC 228155 each 
      partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of AS-IV on the EMT of HMrSV5 cells. 
      CONCLUSION: AS-IV delayed the EMT process in peritoneal mesothelial cells and 
      slowed the progression of PF, potentially serving as a therapeutic agent for the 
      early prevention and treatment of PF. Please cite this article as: Huang Y, Chu
