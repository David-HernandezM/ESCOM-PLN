AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) have been associated with 
      poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring, but the role of familial 
      confounding in these associations is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
      associations of maternal HDP with risks in offspring of autism spectrum disorders 
      (ASDs), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intellectual 
      disability (ID), as well as variation in overall cognitive performance in 
      offspring. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This Swedish register-based study 
      used data from a birth cohort divided into 1 085 024 individuals born between 
      1987 and 1996 and followed up until December 31, 2014, and 285 901 men born 
      between 1982 and 1992 who attended assessments for military conscription, 
      including a cognitive function test. Statistical analysis was performed from 
      April 1, 2019, to June 1, 2020. EXPOSURES: Diagnoses of HDP, which were provided 
      by the Medical Birth Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnoses of ASDs, 
      ADHD, and ID were extracted from the National Patient Register. Cognitive 
      function was assessed using written tests and summarized as a single 9-point 
      score. Whole-cohort and within-sibship analyses were performed; the latter 
      accounted for unmeasured familial confounding factors shared by siblings. 
      RESULTS: The study included 1 085 024 individuals (556 912 male participants 
      [51.3%]) born between 1987 and 1996 and 285 901 men born between 1982 and 1992 
      who attended assessments for military conscription. The prevalence of maternal 
      HDP was 4.0% in the 1987-1996 birth cohort (n = 42 980) and 5.1% in the military 
      conscription cohort (n = 14 515). A total of 15 858 participants received a 
      diagnosis of ASD, 36 852 received a diagnosis of ADHD, and 8454 received a 
      diagnosis of ID. The mean (SD) cognitive score among the men in the conscription 
      cohort was 5.1 (1.9). In whole-cohort analyses with multivariable adjustment, HDP 
      were associated with offspring ASDs (hazard ratio [HR], 1.22; 95% CI, 1.13-1.31), 
      ADHD (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and ID (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27-1.53). 
      Analyses comparing siblings discordant for HDP were less statistically powered 
      but indicated estimates of similar magnitude for ASDs (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 
      1.00-1.42) and possibly ADHD (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.95-1.24), but not for ID (HR, 
      1.04; 95% CI, 0.83-1.29). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were associated 
      with somewhat lower cognitive scores in whole-cohort analysis (mean difference 
      comparing offspring exposed with those unexposed, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.07), 
      but in within-sibship analysis, the association was null (mean difference, 0.00; 
      95% CI, -0.09 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study results suggest that 
      HDP are associated with small increased risks of ASDs and possibly ADHD in 
      offspring, whereas associations with ID and cognitive performance are likely 
      confounded by shared familial (environmental or genetic) factors.
