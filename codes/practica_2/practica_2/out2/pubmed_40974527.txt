TI  - AR/ERK co-targeting triggers ferroptosis via FOXC2 in triple-negative breast 
      cancer.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most aggressive subtype of breast 
      cancer, notably lacks effective treatment strategies. Although androgen receptor 
      (AR) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC, monotherapy with AR 
      inhibitors has proven to be of restricted efficacy. Aiming to develop superior 
      therapeutic approaches, a comprehensive drug library screening was conducted. The 
      ERK inhibitor GDC-0994 exhibited significant synergistic effects with the AR 
      inhibitor bicalutamide. Transcriptome sequencing showed that this combination 
      therapy activates ferroptosis, as evidenced by elevated ROS, increased Fe(2+) 
      levels, a reduced GSH/GSSG ratio, and lipid peroxide accumulation (MDA and 
      4-HNE). FOXC2 was identified as a key mediator of this synergy. Specifically, the 
      combination therapy inhibits FOXC2-driven EMT and induces ferroptosis via the 
      FOXC2-Hippo signaling axis, suppressing tumor proliferation, migration, and 
      invasion. In summary, this study uncovers the value of AR/ERK co-targeting in 
      TNBC, which might potentiate the development of novel targeted therapeutic 
      strategies in TNBC.
