TI  - Adaptive Phenol-Based Hydrogel Embedded with Metformin Nanoparticles Targets 
      Oxidative Stress and Ferroptosis for Spinal Cord Injury Repair.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes irreversible neurological damage largely due to 
      secondary processes such as ferroptosis and inflammation response, which hinder 
      functional recovery and lack effective targeted treatments. Ferroptosis, an 
      iron-dependent form of cell death driven by oxidative stress, and a 
      pro-inflammatory microenvironment contribute significantly to neuronal loss after 
      SCI. To address these challenges, we developed MCPAD, an injectable, self-healing 
      nanocomposite hydrogel incorporating metformin-loaded PLGA nanoparticles 
      (Met@PLGA NPs) and phenol-derived dynamic cross-linked network (CPAD). This 
      multifunctional platform enables targeted suppression of ferroptosis and 
      immunomodulation. In vitro, MCPAD significantly enhanced neuronal viability by 
      regulating iron homeostasis and upregulating antioxidant defenses. In vivo, it 
      reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, glial scarring, and 
      inflammatory cytokine expression, while promoting axonal regeneration and 
      synaptic remodeling. Treated animals exhibited greatly improved locomotor 
      recovery and tissue preservation. Biochemical assessments confirmed systemic 
      biosafety. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MCPAD as a 
      biological responsive platform that reprograms the injury microenvironment to 
      support functional neural repair after SCI.
