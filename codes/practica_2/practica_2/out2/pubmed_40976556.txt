AB  - BACKGROUND: Prostate-related diseases exhibit an extremely high incidence among 
      aging males, including Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate Cancer 
      (PCa). Prostate stem cells are critical for prostate development, adult tissue 
      homeostasis, and injury repair, and are also considered potential cells of origin 
      for tumorigenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that various prostate stem 
      cell populations serve as key drivers in both the initiation and progression of 
      prostatic diseases, while also contributing to therapy resistance. Consequently, 
      prostate stem cells have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for both 
      fundamental research and clinical translational studies. AIM OF REVIEW: This 
      review provides a comprehensive summary of the identity and characteristics of 
      various prostate epithelial stem cells, elaborating on the cell fate and function 
      of different prostate stem cells under both physiological and pathological 
      conditions. Additionally, the review offers theoretical evidence linking the 
      lineage plasticity of prostate stem cells to the drug resistance observed in 
      prostate diseases, and critically discusses both the limitations and therapeutic 
      potential of emerging stem cell-targeting strategies. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF 
      REVIEW: This review integrates contemporary knowledge regarding the identity and 
      cellular plasticity of prostate stem cell subpopulations across physiological and 
      pathological contexts, encompassing prostate development, tissue homeostasis, 
      inflammatory responses, and oncogenesis. These stem cells demonstrate critical 
      adaptability to microenvironmental challenges, underpinning essential functions 
      in epithelial regeneration, neoplastic initiation, and tumor evolution. 
      Significantly, their capacity to dynamically reprogram cellular fate trajectories 
      has been shown to fundamentally underpin mechanisms of therapeutic evasion, 
      fostering the emergence of treatment resistance. Collectively, these insights 
      position the molecular targeting of prostate stem cells as a novel therapeutic 
      paradigm for managing advanced prostate malignancies.
