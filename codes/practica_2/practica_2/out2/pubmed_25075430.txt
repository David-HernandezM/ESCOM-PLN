AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP)/paracetamol is one of the most commonly used 
      over-the-counter drugs taken worldwide for treatment of pain and fever. Although 
      considered as safe when taken in recommended doses not higher than 4 g/day, APAP 
      overdose is currently the most important cause of acute liver failure (ALF). ALF 
      may require liver transplantation and can be fatal. The reasons for APAP-related 
      ALF are mostly intentional (suicidal) or unintentional overdose. However, results 
      from large scale epidemiological studies provide increasing evidence for second 
      generation effects of APAP, even when taken in pharmacological doses. Most 
      strikingly, APAP medication during pregnancy has been associated with health 
      problems including neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders such as attention 
      deficit hyperactivity disorder and increase in the risk of wheezing and incidence 
      of asthma among offspring. This article reviews the epidemiological findings and 
      aims to shed light into the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for 
      APAP-mediated prenatal risk for asthma.
