TI  - Acetaminophen use in pregnancy and neurodevelopment: attention function and 
      autism spectrum symptoms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen is extensively used during pregnancy. But there is a 
      lack of population-representative cohort studies evaluating its effects on a 
      range of neuropsychological and behavioural endpoints. We aimed to assess whether 
      prenatal exposure to acetaminophen is adversely associated with 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1 and 5 years of age. METHODS: This Spanish birth 
      cohort study included 2644 mother-child pairs recruited during pregnancy. The 
      proportion of liveborn participants evaluated at 1 and 5 years was 88.8% and 
      79.9%, respectively. Use of acetaminophen was evaluated prospectively in two 
      structured interviews. Ever/never use and frequency of use (never, sporadic, 
      persistent) were measured. Main neurodevelopment outcomes were assessed using 
      Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST), Conner's Kiddie Continuous Performance 
      Test (K-CPT) and ADHD-DSM-IV form list. Regression models were adjusted for 
      social determinants and co-morbidities. RESULTS: Over 40% of mothers reported 
      using acetaminophen. Ever-exposed offspring had higher risks of presenting more 
      hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.41, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.98), K-CPT commission errors (IRR = 1.10, 
      1.03-1.17), and lower detectability scores (coefficient β = -0.75, -0.13--0.02). 
      CAST scores were increased in ever-exposed males (β = 0.63, 0.09-1.18). Increased 
      effect sizes of risks by frequency of use were observed for 
      hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (IRR = 2.01, 0.95-4.24) in all children, K-CPT 
      commission errors (IRR = 1.32, 1.05-1.66) and detectability (β = -0.18, 
      -0.36-0.00) in females, and CAST scores in males (β = 1.91, 0.44-3.38). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal acetaminophen exposure was associated with a greater number 
      of autism spectrum symptoms in males and showed adverse effects on 
      attention-related outcomes for both genders. These associations seem to be 
      dependent on the frequency of exposure.
