AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of 
      epilepsy-related mortality. Generalised-particularly nocturnal-convulsive 
      seizures, longstanding epilepsy, and solitary living have been identified 
      retrospectively as risk factors. No definitive electroclinical biomarkers have 
      been prospectively ascertained. This study aimed to identify SUDEP risk markers 
      using multimodality data with long-term follow-up. METHODS: This prospective, 
      multicentre, observational cohort study, conducted at nine centres (eight in the 
      USA and one in the UK), recruited children and adults with epilepsy who were 
      undergoing prolonged video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Inclusion 
      criteria were diagnosis of epilepsy by an epilepsy specialist, with or without 
      drug resistance; age older than 2 months; admission to the epilepsy monitoring 
      unit of a participating centre, with video-EEG monitoring; and completion of at 
      least one 6-month follow-up. Demographic, electroclinical, and cardiorespiratory 
      data were collected at baseline. Participants were followed up long term through 
      routine clinic visits, review of electronic health records, and telephone 
      interviews to collect information about seizure frequency, medication status, and 
      mortality. The primary endpoint was time to SUDEP. Cox proportional hazards 
      models were used to assess significant risk factors. FINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 
      2011, and Dec, 30, 2021, 2632 children and adults with epilepsy were enrolled in 
      this study; 164 were lost to follow-up. 38 (1·54%) of 2468 participants died from 
      SUDEP (12 definite, 18 probable, and eight possible SUDEP cases) and two had 
      near-SUDEP events. Incident SUDEP mortality rate was 4·76 (95% CI 3·37-6·53) 
      cases per 1000 person-years, from a cohort of 7982 person-years. Living alone 
      (hazard ratio 7·62, 95% CI 3·94-14·71), three or more generalised convulsive 
      seizures in the previous year (3·1, 1·64-5·87]), longer ictal central apnoea 
      (1·11, 1·05-1·18), and longer postictal central apnoea (1·32, 1·14-1·54]) were 
      significant predictors of increased SUDEP risk. In a subanalysis excluding 
      possible and near-SUDEP cases, longer ictal central apnoea was not significant. 
      INTERPRETATION: This study shows an association between premortem peri-ictal 
      apnoea and increased SUDEP risk. Cardiorespiratory monitoring during seizures 
      might benefit assessments of epilepsy mortality risk. Together with solitary 
      living and convulsive seizure frequency, peri-ictal apnoea (>14 s for postictal 
      central apnoea and >17 s for ictal central apnoea) could inform the development 
      of a validatable SUDEP risk index. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health.
