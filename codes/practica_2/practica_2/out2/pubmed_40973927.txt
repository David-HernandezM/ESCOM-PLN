AB  - Circulating metabolites are crucial to biological processes underlying health and 
      diseases, yet their genetic determinants remain incompletely understood. Here, we 
      investigate the genetic architecture of nuclear magnetic resonance-based 
      metabolomics, analyzing 249 metabolic measures and 64 biologically plausible 
      ratios in 254,825 participants. We conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
      identifying 24,438 independent variant-metabolite associations across 427 loci, 
      with effect sizes highly concordant with 19 previous studies. Fine-mapping 
      pinpoints 3610 putative causal associations, 785 of which are novel. 
      Additionally, we utilize whole exome sequencing data and uncover 2948 
      gene-metabolite associations through aggregate testing, underscoring the 
      importance of rare coding variants overlooked in GWAS. Integrating our findings 
      with disease genetics reveals potential causal associations, such as between 
      acetate levels and the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Collectively, 
      this study delineates the complex genetic architecture of the plasma metabolome, 
      offering a valuable resource for future investigations into disease mechanisms 
      and therapeutic strategies.
