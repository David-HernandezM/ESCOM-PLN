TI  - Peroxisomal metabolism of branched fatty acids regulates energy homeostasis.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-025-09517-7 [doi]
AB  - Brown and beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial 
      protein that dissociates respiration from ATP synthesis and promotes heat 
      production and energy expenditure. However, UCP1(-/-) mice are not obese(1-5), 
      consistent with the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis(6-8). 
      Here we describe a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis involving 
      ATP-consuming metabolism of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) in 
      peroxisomes. These fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase using 
      precursors derived from catabolism of branched-chain amino acids(9) and our 
      results indicate that β-oxidation of mmBCFAs is mediated by the peroxisomal 
      protein acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Notably, cold exposure upregulated proteins 
      involved in both biosynthesis and β-oxidation of mmBCFA in thermogenic fat. Acute 
      thermogenic stimuli promoted translocation of fatty acid synthase to peroxisomes. 
      Brown-adipose-tissue-specific fatty acid synthase knockout decreased cold 
      tolerance. Adipose-specific ACOX2 knockout also impaired cold tolerance and 
      promoted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, ACOX2 
      overexpression in adipose tissue enhanced thermogenesis independently of UCP1 and 
      improved metabolic homeostasis. Using a peroxisome-localized temperature sensor 
      named Pexo-TEMP, we found that ACOX2-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation raised 
      intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes. These results identify a 
      previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in adipose tissue thermogenesis 
      characterized by an mmBCFA synthesis and catabolism cycle.
