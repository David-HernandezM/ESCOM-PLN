      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Insomnia is highly prevalent among individuals with chronic disease 
      (eg, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and cancer) and results in poorer 
      disease outcomes and quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia 
      (CBT-I) is recommended as first-line treatment for insomnia. However, concerns 
      remain about its applicability and efficacy in people with chronic disease. 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nature, efficacy, and acceptability of CBT-I in adults 
      with chronic disease, and to identify moderators of treatment outcomes. DATA 
      SOURCES: Systematic searches were conducted in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and 
      CENTRAL from database inception to June 5, 2025. Additional records were 
      identified from reference lists of relevant reviews and studies. STUDY SELECTION: 
      Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving adults (aged 
      ≥18 years) with chronic disease and insomnia. Studies using CBT-I with measured 
      sleep outcomes were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two assessors 
      extracted data from RCTs. Hedges g was used to calculate effect sizes, and random 
      effects meta-analyses were conducted. Heterogeneity was assessed via I2. Subgroup 
      analyses examined whether outcomes varied by delivery format, chronic condition 
      type, or control group. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included 
      insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, and sleep onset latency. Secondary outcomes 
      included treatment acceptability and adverse effects. RESULTS: Sixty-seven RCTs 
      (5232 participants) met inclusion criteria, including chronic diseases such as 
      cancer, chronic pain, irritable bowel syndrome, and stroke. CBT-I was associated 
      with significantly improved outcomes for insomnia severity (g = 0.98; 95% CI, 
      0.81-1.16) and moderate effect sizes regarding sleep efficiency (g = 0.77; 95% 
      CI, 0.63-0.91) and sleep onset latency (g = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.78). Subgroup 
      analyses revealed some sample, treatment, and methodological moderators (eg, 
      longer treatment yielded better outcomes for sleep efficiency and sleep onset 
      latency). Satisfaction with CBT-I was high, with a mean dropout rate of 13.3%. 
      Treatment-related adverse effects were rare. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This 
      systematic review and meta-analysis showed that CBT-I demonstrated strong 
      efficacy and acceptability in chronic disease populations, with moderate to large 
      effect sizes that appear comparable to those in non-chronic disease populations. 
      Efficacy of CBT-I was similar across a range of disease subgroups. Future 
      research should explore the role and nature of treatment adaptations for specific 
      populations and increase access to CBT-I in medical settings.
