AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastroparesis is a complex gastric motility disorder 
      characterized by nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms associated with a delay in 
      gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Variations in 
      diagnostic testing and limited effective treatments make caring for this patient 
      population challenging. The American Gastroenterological Association developed 
      this guideline to provide recommendations for ensuring an accurate diagnosis and 
      identifying evidence-based, effective treatments among the available 
      pharmacologic and procedural interventions for patients with idiopathic 
      gastroparesis or gastroparesis related to diabetes. METHODS: The Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to 
      assess evidence and develop this guideline. The Guideline Panel prioritized 
      clinical questions and outcomes, conducted an evidence review, and used the 
      Evidence to Decision Framework to develop recommendations. RESULTS: The Guideline 
      Panel agreed on 12 recommendations. A conditional recommendation was issued 
      against using 2-hour gastric emptying testing and in favor of 4-hour testing in 
      patients with suspected gastroparesis. There are conditional recommendations for 
      the use of metoclopramide and erythromycin in patients with gastroparesis. 
      Conditional recommendations were issued against the use of domperidone, 
      prucalopride, aprepitant, nortriptyline, buspirone, and cannabidiol as first-line 
      therapies. In addition, conditional recommendations were issued against the 
      routine initial use of gastric per-oral endoscopic pyloromyotomy or gastric 
      electrical stimulation in patients with gastroparesis, reserving these treatments 
      for select patients with symptoms refractory to medical therapies. No 
      recommendation was given regarding the use of surgical pyloromyotomy and surgical 
      pyloroplasty, which were identified as procedures with knowledge gaps in their 
      use for treatment for gastroparesis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of gastroparesis 
      requires the use of 4-hour gastric emptying tests. Metoclopramide or erythromycin 
      is appropriate for initial pharmacologic treatment. Other treatment 
      recommendations require shared patient-physician decision making. There are still 
      considerable unmet needs in the treatment of gastroparesis.
