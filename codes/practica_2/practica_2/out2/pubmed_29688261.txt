      Disorder and Autistic Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and 
      Meta-Regression Analysis of Cohort Studies.

AB  - Acetaminophen is the analgesic and antipyretic most commonly used during 
      pregnancy. Evidence of neurodisruptive properties is accumulating. Therefore, we 
      sought to evaluate the risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
      and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring of women exposed to 
      acetaminophen during pregnancy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane 
      databases for relevant studies up to January 2017. Data were independently 
      extracted and assessed by 2 researchers. Seven eligible retrospective cohorts 
      included 132,738 mother-child pairs, with follow-up periods ranging from 3 to 11 
      years. The pooled risk ratio for ADHD was 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.21, 1.47; I2 = 72%); for ASD, the risk ratio was 1.19 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.25; I2 = 
      14%), and for hyperactivity symptoms, it was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.43; I2 = 93%). 
      In meta-regression analysis, the association between exposure and ADHD increased 
      with the child's age upon follow-up (β = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.07) and with the 
      mean duration of exposure (β = 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.01). The available data is 
      of observational nature only. Studies differed widely in exposure and outcome 
      assessment. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with an increased 
      risk for ADHD, ASD, and hyperactivity symptoms. These findings are concerning; 
      however, results should be interpreted with caution given that the available 
      evidence consists of observational studies and is susceptible to several 
      potential sources of bias.
