      disorders in childhood: A Danish national birth cohort study.

AB  - Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is the most commonly used pain and fever medication 
      during pregnancy. Previously, a positive ecological correlation between 
      acetaminophen use and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been reported but 
      evidence from larger studies based on prospective data is lacking. We followed 
      64,322 children and mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC; 
      1996-2002) for average 12.7 years to investigate whether acetaminophen use in 
      pregnancy is associated with increased risk of ASD in the offspring. Information 
      on acetaminophen use was collected prospectively from three computer-assisted 
      telephone interviews. We used records from the Danish hospital and psychiatric 
      registries to identify diagnoses of ASD. At the end of follow up, 1,027 (1.6%) 
      children were diagnosed with ASD, 345 (0.5%) with infantile autism. We found that 
      31% of ASD (26% of infantile autism) have also been diagnosed with hyperkinetic 
      disorders. More than 50% women reported ever using acetaminophen in pregnancy. We 
      used Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
      confident interval (CI). Prenatal use of acetaminophen was associated with an 
      increased risk of ASD accompanied by hyperkinetic symptoms (HR = 1.51 95% CI 
      1.19-1.92), but not with other ASD cases (HR = 1.06 95% CI 0.92-1.24). Longer 
      duration of use (i.e., use for >20 weeks in gestation) increased the risk of ASD 
      or infantile autism with hyperkinetic symptoms almost twofold. Maternal use of 
      acetaminophen in pregnancy was associated with ASD with hyperkinetic symptoms 
      only, suggesting acetaminophen exposure early in fetal life may specifically 
      impact this hyperactive behavioral phenotype. Autism Res 2016, 9: 951-958. © 2015
