AB  - Despite having multiple treatment options, the overall outcomes, including the 
      survival rates of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, remain relatively 
      low, indicating the need to explore new approaches to achieve improved 
      therapeutic responses. To that end, repurposed drugs such as metformin have been 
      evaluated against many cancer types, including NSCLC. Metformin, a widely used 
      oral hypoglycemic drug for type 2 diabetes, exhibits anticancer properties and 
      synergy with several standards of care agents. In this review, we provide a 
      comprehensive overview of the role and anticancer mechanisms of metformin-based 
      combination approaches for the treatment of NSCLC. We logically discussed the 
      experimental evidence from the in vitro and in vivo studies utilizing metformin 
      alone, and then its combination with chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapy, 
      and immunotherapy. We also present clinical trials that underscore the beneficial 
      and adverse outcomes of metformin use in combination with targeted therapy and 
      chemotherapeutic agents, and emphasize the limitations and challenges for the 
      treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic NSCLC patients. It appears that, 
      regardless of the diverse anticancer mechanisms of this biguanide, the benefits 
      may be confined to a specific patient subgroup, which opens new avenues to be 
      explored for NSCLC treatment.
