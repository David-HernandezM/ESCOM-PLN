TI  - Maintenance of neuronal TDP-43 expression requires axonal lysosome transport.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.104057 [doi]
LID - RP104057
AB  - TDP-43 mislocalization and pathology occurs across a range of neurodegenerative 
      diseases, but the pathways that modulate TDP-43 in neurons are not well 
      understood. We generated a Halo-TDP-43 knock-in human induced pluripotent stem 
      cell (iPSC) line and performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference FACS-based 
      screen to identify modifiers of TDP-43 levels in neurons. A meta-analysis of our 
      screen and publicly available screens identified both specific hits and pathways 
      present across multiple screens, the latter likely responsible for generic 
      protein level maintenance. We identified BORC, a complex required for anterograde 
      lysosome transport, as a specific modifier of TDP-43 protein, but not mRNA, 
      levels in neurons. BORC loss led to longer half-life of TDP-43 and other 
      proteins, suggesting lysosome location is required for proper protein turnover. 
      As such, lysosome location and function are crucial for maintaining TDP-43 
      protein levels in neurons.
