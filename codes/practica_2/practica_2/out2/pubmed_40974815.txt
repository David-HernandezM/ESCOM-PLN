AB  - BACKGROUND: End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) endure 
      a high symptom burden. Despite the clinical importance of symptom management, 
      traditional methods fail to predict intervention effects or identify optimal 
      targets due to limited consideration of symptom interactions. Computational 
      simulations with symptom network analysis to identify core intervention targets 
      for personalized care is needed. DESIGN: Computational simulated modeling study 
      using cross-sectional observational data. SETTING: Across five regions of 
      China-northern, southern, western, eastern, and central. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 
      1866 hemodialysis patients participated in the study. METHODS: A combination of 
      variable-centered and person-centered approaches was used to simplify the 
      symptoms measured by real patient-reported data, followed by latent profile 
      analysis to classify patients into symptom burden profiles. In silico 
      interventions were performed using the NodeIdentifyR algorithm to simulate the 
      effects of alleviating and aggravating interventions on the symptom network. 
      RESULTS: Four symptom clusters were identified: uremic toxin, water-electrolyte, 
      psychological, and gastrointestinal. Latent profile analysis revealed two 
      distinct patient profiles: severe and mild symptom groups. Network analysis 
      highlighted key symptoms such as pruritus, fatigue, anxiety, and easy awakening 
      as central nodes. The in silico interventions in overall groups showed that 
      alleviating interventions targeting easy awakening, fatigue and pruritus as core 
      targets. Treating these may reduce the symptom burden by 10.25 %, 10.00 % and 
      9.82 %. Aggravating interventions identified pruritus, dry skin and easy 
      awakening as pivotal targets. Preventing the presence of these may separately 
      reduce the symptom burden by 24.69 %, 23.05 % and 22.21 %. CONCLUSION: This study 
      provides critical insights into the symptom burden of hemodialysis patients, 
      offering potential targets for personalized care plans for nurses. The results of 
      computational simulations, if go through further longitudinal study for 
      verification, the study has potential to advance the development of more tailored 
      and effective symptom management care approaches, which could enhance patient 
      care and quality of life.
