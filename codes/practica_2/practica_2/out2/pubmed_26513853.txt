TI  - Fluoride content and labelling of toothpastes marketed in India.
PG  - 170-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To enumerate the fluoride content and labelling practices of 
      toothpastes marketed in India and to determine if the content is in accordance 
      with the information provided on the packaging. METHOD: In vitro analysis of 
      total and free available fluoride in 5 adult and 5 children's fluoride 
      toothpastes in India using fluoride ion electrode. Information on the tube and 
      carton was checked to assess the labelling. RESULTS: The mean Total Fluoride 
      concentrations (TF) in the toothpastes labelled 1,000 ppm, 500ppm and 458 ppm 
      were 1,000, 500 and 449mg/L (sd values 3, 5 and 4mg/L) respectively. The 
      toothpastes' Total Soluble Fluoride (TSF) concentration was generally slightly 
      less than the TF concentration. Overall mean percentage of TSF concentration was 
      94% sd 9%. The mean percentage of TSF concentration in SMFP (sodium 
      monofluorophosphate)/CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) containing toothpastes was 86% sd 
      16% while that in NaF (sodium fluoride)/Si (silica) based toothpastes was 98% sd 
      1% and 95% sd 1% in the remaining toothpastes with unknown abrasive. NaF/Si based 
      toothpastes had more TSF concentration than the others (p<0.05). All the 
      information required by the Indian regulations was shown on all 10 toothpastes. 
      CONCLUSION: The available fluoride content of one of the ten toothpastes was 
      substantially less than the total fluoride content. Although the toothpastes were 
      labelled following the guidelines of the regulatory body of India, 3 of the 10 
      failed to mention the abrasive present.
