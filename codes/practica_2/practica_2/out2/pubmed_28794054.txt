TI  - Cardiovascular Event Prediction by Machine Learning: The Multi-Ethnic Study of 
      Atherosclerosis.

AB  - RATIONALE: Machine learning may be useful to characterize cardiovascular risk, 
      predict outcomes, and identify biomarkers in population studies. OBJECTIVE: To 
      test the ability of random survival forests, a machine learning technique, to 
      predict 6 cardiovascular outcomes in comparison to standard cardiovascular risk 
      scores. METHODS AND RESULTS: We included participants from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic 
      Study of Atherosclerosis). Baseline measurements were used to predict 
      cardiovascular outcomes over 12 years of follow-up. MESA was designed to study 
      progression of subclinical disease to cardiovascular events where participants 
      were initially free of cardiovascular disease. All 6814 participants from MESA, 
      aged 45 to 84 years, from 4 ethnicities, and 6 centers across the United States 
      were included. Seven-hundred thirty-five variables from imaging and noninvasive 
      tests, questionnaires, and biomarker panels were obtained. We used the random 
      survival forests technique to identify the top-20 predictors of each outcome. 
      Imaging, electrocardiography, and serum biomarkers featured heavily on the top-20 
      lists as opposed to traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Age was the most 
      important predictor for all-cause mortality. Fasting glucose levels and carotid 
      ultrasonography measures were important predictors of stroke. Coronary Artery 
      Calcium score was the most important predictor of coronary heart disease and all 
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease combined outcomes. Left ventricular 
      structure and function and cardiac troponin-T were among the top predictors for 
      incident heart failure. Creatinine, age, and ankle-brachial index were among the 
      top predictors of atrial fibrillation. TNF-α (tissue necrosis factor-α) and IL 
      (interleukin)-2 soluble receptors and NT-proBNP (N-Terminal Pro-B-Type 
      Natriuretic Peptide) levels were important across all outcomes. The random 
      survival forests technique performed better than established risk scores with 
      increased prediction accuracy (decreased Brier score by 10%-25%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Machine learning in conjunction with deep phenotyping improves prediction 
      accuracy in cardiovascular event prediction in an initially asymptomatic 
      population. These methods may lead to greater insights on subclinical disease 
      markers without apriori assumptions of causality. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:
