TI  - Macrophage ferroptosis potentiates GCN2 deficiency induced pulmonary venous 
      arterialization.

AB  - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a fatal disease characterized by the 
      remodelling of pulmonary veins and haemosiderin accumulation in macrophages. 
      Although (General Control Nonderepressible 2) GCN2 deficiency has been reported 
      in PVOD patients, the underlying mechanism by which GCN2 deficiency affects the 
      pulmonary venous cells and the surrounding cells, remains unclear. Here, we 
      perform immunohistochemistry and scRNA-sequencing analyses to show that 
      macrophages are the major population affected by GCN2 deficiency and ferroptosis 
      pathway-related genes are upregulated in lung macrophages of PVOD patients. 
      Treatment with the specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) reverses 
      the changes in haemodynamic indices observed in Eif2ak4(K1488X/K1488X) hypoxia 
      mice and PVOD model rats. Furthermore, GCN2 deficiency increases HMOX1 and iron 
      levels to facilitate ferroptosis in macrophages, and enhances arterial marker 
      expression in venous endothelial cells (VECs). Specifically, spatial 
      transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of NRP1, KDR and EFNB2 through 
      ETS1 in VECs from PVOD patients. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting 
      macrophage ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy for treating related vascular 
      diseases, and of using NRP1/KDR/EFNB2 expression as a specific marker set for 
      venous arterialization.
