AB  - PURPOSE: Testosterone levels are influenced by behavioral and environmental 
      factors. As modern lifestyles have become increasingly sedentary with less time 
      spent outdoors, understanding how daily outdoor exposure relates to serum 
      testosterone may offer insight into the hormonal effects of contemporary behavior 
      patterns. We evaluated the correlation between daily time spent outdoors (TSO) 
      and serum testosterone. METHODS: We identified adult men from the National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 2011-2014. TSO was 
      measured in average minutes per day (MPD). Low testosterone was defined as serum 
      morning total testosterone < 300 ng/dL. Survey-weighted multivariable logistic 
      and linear regression models were used to identify factors correlated with low 
      testosterone and serum testosterone, respectively, while correcting for age, 
      education, household income, BMI, physical activity (both self-reported and 
      accelerometer-determined), diabetes, vitamin D concentration, and dietary habits. 
      RESULTS: 2,205 men were included. Mean age, testosterone, and MPD TSO were 45.8 
      years, 448.34 ng/dL, and 144.3 minutes, respectively. 19.3% of men had low 
      testosterone. TSO was significantly associated with both serum testosterone 
      (β=9.25 per 1 hour outside daily, p=0.007) and decreased odds of low testosterone 
      (OR=0.86 per 1 hour outside daily, 95% CI 0.76-0.97, p=0.01) in multivariate 
      analysis. Increasing age, BMI, and diabetes were positively correlated with low 
      testosterone, while increasing physical activity was inversely correlated with 
      low testosterone (p≤0.01 for all). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to 
      describe a correlation between increased outdoor time and lower prevalence of low 
      testosterone, independent of age, education, household income, BMI, physical 
      activity, diabetes, vitamin D concentration, and dietary habits.
