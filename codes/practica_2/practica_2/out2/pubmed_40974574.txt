AB  - Multiciliated cells (MCCs) bear numerous motile cilia that drive fluid flow, but 
      how numerous centrioles for multiciliation are generated has remained unresolved. 
      Here, we report that the "master" MCC transcriptional regulator, MCIDAS, 
      moonlights in the cytoplasm to organize massive centriole biogenesis. Like 
      MCIDAS, its co-transcriptional factors, E2F4 and E2F5, also undergo cytoplasmic 
      accumulation, colocalizing with MCIDAS and forming procentrioles. MCIDAS loss 
      inhibited E2F4/5 cytoplasmic accumulation and blocked centriole assembly. 
      Furthermore, we show that the cytoplasmic accumulation of MCIDAS is mediated by 
      CRM1-dependant nuclear export, and its inhibition specifically compromised 
      centriole biogenesis. By contrast, on loss of parental centrioles and 
      deuterosomes, which does not impair centriole formation, E2F4 cytoplasmic 
      localization remained unaffected, establishing that the MCIDAS-E2F4/5 cytoplasmic 
      complex represents the de novo centriole biogenesis pathway. We have also 
      assembled a comprehensive list of MCIDAS targets, a resource which will enable 
      further exposition of MCC biology and pathological mechanisms of motile 
      ciliopathies.
