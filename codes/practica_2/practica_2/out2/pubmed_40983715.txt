TI  - A bottom-up septal inhibitory circuit mediates anticipatory control of drinking.

AB  - Drinking behavior is not only homeostatically regulated but also rapidly adjusted 
      before any changes in blood osmolality occur, known as anticipatory thirst 
      satiation. Homeostatic and anticipatory signals converge in the subfornical organ 
      (SFO); however, the neural pathways conveying peripheral information to the SFO 
      before changes in blood composition are incompletely understood. Here we reveal 
      an inhibitory pathway from the medial septum (MS) to the SFO that is involved in 
      the control of anticipatory drinking behavior in mice. MS γ-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA)ergic neurons encode water-satiation signals by integrating cues from the 
      oral cavity and tracking gastrointestinal signals. These neurons receive inputs 
      from the parabrachial nucleus and relay to SFO(CaMKII) neurons, forming a 
      bottom-up pathway with activity that prevents overhydration. Disruption of this 
      circuit leads to excessive water intake and hyponatremia. Our findings reveal a 
      septal pathway that integrates multiple layers of presystemic signals to 
      fine-tune drinking behavior.
