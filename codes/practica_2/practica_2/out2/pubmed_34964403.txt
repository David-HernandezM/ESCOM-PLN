AB  - INTRODUCTION: A high number of women are exposed to acetaminophen during 
      pregnancy worldwide. This drug safety during pregnancy regarding preterm birth, 
      birth weight, and fetal development has not been well described. This study 
      investigated the effect of acetaminophen use during pregnancy on selected adverse 
      pregnancy outcomes. AREAS COVERED: Databases were searched to identify studies 
      reporting the effects of acetaminophen use during pregnancy on preterm birth, low 
      birth weight, and small for gestational age. The studies' quality was assessed by 
      the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized 
      Studies. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were estimated using a fixed 
      or random-effects model. Six studies were included for final review, four cohort 
      and two case-control studies. We found no increased risk of preterm birth (RR 
      0.97; 95% CI 0.59-1.58), and decreased risks of low birth weight (RR 0.65; 95% CI 
      0.59-0.72) and small for gestational age (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.97). 
      Acetaminophen exposure during the third trimester revealed non-significantly in 
      the outcomes. EXPERT OPINION: Exposure to acetaminophen during pregnancy appears 
      to not increase the risk of the outcomes analyzed. However, there is a lack of 
      information regarding the exposure dose and frequency of acetaminophen use.
