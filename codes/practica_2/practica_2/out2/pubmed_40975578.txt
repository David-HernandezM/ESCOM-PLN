AB  - BACKGROUND: Computed Tomography (CT) was widely used for COVID-19 patients to 
      assess extent of lung abnormalities and disease severity. Most CT scoring systems 
      have relied on the extent of lung involvement. OBJECTIVES: We developed a novel 
      CT scoring system- Composite Radiological Score (CRS) incorporating both extent 
      and density of lung lesions to assess the trends in CRS at admission, 4-8 weeks 
      and 10-12 weeks post-admission, estimate inter-reader agreement and correlate CRS 
      with clinical severity. METHODS: A prospective, observational study of 
      consecutive adult patients admitted with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia 
      (June to September 2020) in a tertiary hospital in North India. Clinical data, CT 
      images and CRS were recorded sequentially at admission (CT1) and 4-8 weeks (CT2) 
      in all patients, and at 10-12 weeks (CT3) in a subgroup of patients. RESULTS: CRS 
      was significantly associated with clinical severity (p-value = 0.003), d-dimer 
      (p-value = 0.004), serum ferritin (p-value = 0.03) and median length of stay 
      (p-value = 0.02). At 4-8 weeks, proportion of patients with CRS>3 (15 %) was 
      significantly lower than those with the extent of lung involvement>25 % (30 %). 
      Kappa agreement with regards to density of lesions and CRS score was moderate to 
      substantial except for one pair of radiologist where fair agreement was recorded. 
      Higher kappa agreement was seen in CT2 and CT3 compared to CT1. CONCLUSION: CRS 
      correlated well with clinical severity and other laboratory parameters of disease 
      severity. CRS provides a new method to non-invasively assess the severity of 
      diffuse lung abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia that incorporates both the 
      extent and density of lung lesions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: CRS will be useful to 
      assess severity and longitudinally monitor clinical course of patients with 
      airspace predominant lung abnormalities.
