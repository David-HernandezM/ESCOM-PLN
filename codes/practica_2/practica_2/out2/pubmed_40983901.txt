AB  - BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a prevalent auditory disorder that significantly affects 
      quality of life, with emerging evidence suggesting a connection between metabolic 
      dysregulation and tinnitus pathogenesis. The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), a 
      marker of atherogenic lipid metabolism, has been associated with cardiovascular 
      disease risk but remains underexplored in the context of tinnitus. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study aimed to investigate the relationship between AIP and tinnitus 
      prevalence in U.S. adults, and to further examine whether hypertension mediates 
      this association. METHODS: We analyzed data from 2,464 participants in the 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2012). Tinnitus 
      status was determined by self-report, and AIP was calculated as 
      log10(triglycerides/HDL-C). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to 
      assess the association between AIP and tinnitus. Stratified analyses and 
      mediation analysis were conducted to explore effect modification and the 
      mediating role of hypertension. Hypertension was defined as a self-reported 
      physician diagnosis or use of antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Elevated AIP 
      was significantly associated with an increased risk of tinnitus in a 
      dose-response manner (fully adjusted OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52, P = 0.01). 
      Stronger associations were observed in younger participants, females, 
      non-Hispanic Whites, and smokers. Mediation analysis showed that hypertension 
      partially mediated the association between AIP and Tinnitus, accounting for 
      17.53% of the total effect. CONCLUSIONS: Higher AIP is associated with greater 
      tinnitus prevalence, with hypertension serving as a partial mediator. These 
      findings highlight the potential value of AIP as a metabolic biomarker for 
      tinnitus risk stratification and emphasize the importance of managing metabolic 
      dysregulation in tinnitus prevention.
