TI  - Suppression of FHL2 expression induces cell differentiation and inhibits gastric 
      and colon carcinogenesis.
PG  - 1066-76
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: FHL2 (4-1/2 LIM protein 2) is an adapter and modifier in 
      protein interactions that is expressed mainly in the heart and ovary. It 
      functions in a cell type- or promoter-specific manner. The aims of this study 
      were to examine its expression in gastrointestinal cancers and to determine its 
      role in cell differentiation and tumorigenesis. METHODS: FHL2 expression in 
      cancerous and normal gastrointestinal cells was detected by reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. The effect 
      of FHL2 suppression by both antisense and siRNA methods on cell differentiation 
      and growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: FHL2 expression was 
      up-regulated in gastrointestinal cancer, compared with matched normal tissues. 
      Stable transfection of gastric cancer cell line, AGS, and colon cancer cell line, 
      Lovo, with antisense FHL2 induced lengthened or shuttle-shape morphologic changes 
      with long or dendritic-like cytoplasmic processes and decreased the 
      nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio. FHL2 antisense induced expressions of carcinoembryonic 
      antigen and E-cadherin and the maturation of F-actin. Furthermore, FHL2 antisense 
      inhibited the transcriptions of some oncogenes including cox-2, survivin, c-jun, 
      and hTERT, and suppressed the promoter activity of activator protein-1 and hTERT. 
      Suppression of FHL2 inhibited serum-dependent, anchorage-dependent and 
      -independent cell growth, and suppressed de novo tumor formation in nude mice 
      xenograft. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of FHL2 induces cell differentiation and 
      inhibits tumorigenesis. Antisense or siRNA methods targeting FHL2 is a promising 
      strategy for treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.
