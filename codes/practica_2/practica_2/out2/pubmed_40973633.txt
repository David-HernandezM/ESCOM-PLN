AB  - AIMS: This study examines how changes in depressive symptoms influence 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence in diverse aging populations. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Data from four longitudinal cohorts were harmonized: CHARLS (China), 
      ELSA (UK), HRS (US), and MHAS (Mexico). Depressive symptoms were assessed at 
      baseline and follow-up using validated scales, and scores were standardized using 
      z-scores. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined as a composite of heart 
      attack, angina, congestive heart failure, other physician-diagnosed heart 
      conditions, and stroke. Cox proportional regression analyses assessed the 
      associations between changes in depressive symptoms and CVD risk. Progression 
      from no depression to mild depression was associated with a 28% increase in CVD 
      risk (95% CI: 1.14-1.44), while progression to moderate-to-severe depression was 
      associated with a 23% increase (95% CI: 1.04-1.46). Conversely, remission from 
      mild depression to no depression significantly reduced CVD risk by 19% (95% CI: 
      0.68-0.98). Improvement from moderate-to-severe depression to mild depression 
      decreased CVD risk by 25% (95% CI: 0.61-0.93), and remission from 
      moderate-to-severe depression to no depression reduced it by 38% (95% CI: 
      0.50-0.76). Each 1-unit increase in the total depression score raised CVD risk by 
      12% (95% CI: 1.10-1.14), while each 1-unit increase in depression score change 
      increased risk by 15% (95% CI: 1.11-1.19). Effects were stronger in participants 
      aged <65 years than participants aged ≥65 years. CONCLUSION: This multinational 
      cohort study demonstrates that worsening or progression of depressive symptoms 
      increases CVD risk, while remission or improvement confers protective effects, 
      highlighting the need to monitor depression symptom changes in CVD prevention.

OAB - This multinational longitudinal study investigated how changes in depressive 
      symptoms influence the risk of incident CVD across four aging populations from 
      diverse regions (China, UK, US, and Mexico). Utilizing harmonized data from four 
      prospective cohort studies (CHARLS, ELSA, HRS, MHAS; N = 33,437), we found 
      significant associations between depressive symptom changes and CVD incidence. 
      Key findings revealed that: (1) Progression or worsening of depressive symptoms 
      increased CVD risk: progression from no depression to mild depression increased 
      CVD risk by 28% (95% CI: 1.14-1.44), while progression to moderate-to-severe 
      depression raised CVD risk by 23% (95% CI: 1.04-1.46); (2) Improvement or 
      remission of depressive symptoms reduced CVD risk: remission from mild depression 
      to no depression significantly reduced CVD risk by 19% (95% CI: 0.68-0.98); 
      improvement from moderate-to-severe depression to mild depression decreased CVD 
      risk by 25% (95% CI: 0.61-0.93), and remission from moderate-to-severe depression 
      to no depression reduced it by 38% (95% CI: 0.50-0.76). Furthermore, continuous 
      measures demonstrated a robust dose-response relationship, with each 1-unit 
      increase in the total depression score raised CVD risk by 12% (95% CI: 
      1.10-1.14), while each 1-unit increase in depressive symptom change increased 
      risk by 15% (95% CI: 1.11-1.19). These findings highlight the importance of 
      monitoring depressive symptoms in CVD prevention, and suggest that interventions 
      targeting depressive symptoms may benefit cardiovascular health.
