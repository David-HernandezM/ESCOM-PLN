AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe complication of systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE), characterised by kidney inflammation, tubular injury, and 
      interstitial fibrosis. However, the spatial organisation of these heterogeneous 
      cell populations and their regulatory mechanisms in LN remain poorly understood. 
      The objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms 
      underlying region-specific kidney lesions and tubular damage in LN. METHODS: We 
      performed single-cell multiome and spatial transcriptomic analyses on kidney 
      biopsy samples from patients with LN and controls, integrating data from the 
      largest East Asian SLE genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (208,370 samples) 
      to date. Validation experiments were performed using multiplex 
      immunohistochemistry (mIHC), in vitro lentiviral-mediated transcription factor 
      overexpression, and functional stimulation assays. RESULTS: We identified 
      VCAM1-expressing proximal tubule (PT_VCAM1) cells as components of an LN-specific 
      inflammatory niche (niche 5) localised in the kidney cortex. Both in silico and 
      in vitro experiments demonstrated that interactions between PT_VCAM1 cells and 
      myofibroblasts, as well as immune cells in niche 5, promote their 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Trajectory analysis suggested that PT_VCAM1 
      cells originate from a failed-repair pathway in proximal tubule cells, regulated 
      by transcriptional networks involving BACH2. Integrative GWAS analysis further 
      linked SLE-associated risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory 
      elements specific to PT_VCAM1 cells, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      within the distal enhancer of the BMP2K locus, which establishes a BACH2 motif. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings characterise PT_VCAM1 cells as 
      injury-responsive cell states that contribute to the inflammatory and fibrotic 
      niche in LN, linking genetic predisposition to cellular injury and disease 
      progression.
