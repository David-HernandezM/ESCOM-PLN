AB  - The purpose of this study is to review the published papers investigating 
      maternal acetaminophen (AP) use during pregnancy and its effect on the 
      offspring's neurodevelopment, particularly autism spectrum disorders (ASD). 
      Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic considered safe in 
      pregnancy. Recent studies have found an association between acetaminophen and 
      immune system alterations like asthma and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. We 
      used online databases (PubMed/Medline/PubMed Central, Science Direct, and Google 
      Scholar) to search the studies relevant to our topic. We screened the papers by 
      titles, abstracts, and then full-text availability. The screened articles were 
      checked for eligibility using relevant quality assessment tools for each study 
      design, extracting and analyzing the data. We finalized 30 studies after the 
      screening; 14 were ineligible. Our final selection included 16 high-quality 
      papers - 13 prospective cohort studies, two review articles, and one 
      meta-analysis. We found a wide range of neurodevelopmental outcomes in our data 
      collection. So, we included autism spectrum disorders, intelligent quotient (IQ), 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), isolated language, attention and 
      executive function, communication, behavior, and psychomotor development. All 
      studies showed an association between acetaminophen use and listed 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. Long-term use, increased dose, and frequency were 
      associated with a stronger association. We extracted collective evidence from 16 
      studies suggesting acetaminophen's role in developing adverse neurodevelopmental 
      outcomes. It is urgent to do more research on this association before pregnant 
      women can be cautioned about the precise use of acetaminophen.
