AB  - Acetaminophen is a common over-the-counter medication that recently gained 
      substantial media attention regarding its use by pregnant individuals. In this 
      clinical perspective, we discuss the strengths and limitations of the published 
      literature on the effect of maternal acetaminophen use in pregnancy on the 
      child's risk of developing attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
      and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies included were specifically selected 
      on the basis of the quality and validity of ADHD or ASD outcome definitions. From 
      a total of 56 identified studies, commentaries, and editorials of relevance, we 
      critically reviewed nine studies with original data that satisfied our inclusion 
      criteria and three meta-analyses. Most studies that have reported positive 
      findings are difficult to interpret because they have important biases, notably a 
      high degree of selection bias, variability in selection and adjustment for 
      various potential confounders, and unmeasured familial confounding. When 
      unobserved familial confounding through sibling analysis was controlled for, 
      associations weakened substantially. This suggests that residual confounding from 
      shared genetic and environmental factors may have caused an upward bias in the 
      original observations. According to the current scientific evidence, in utero 
      exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased 
      risk of childhood ADHD or ASD. The current level of evidence does not warrant 
      changes to clinical guidelines on the treatment of fever or pain in pregnancy. 
      Prospective research designed to account for familial and psychosocial 
      environmental factors related to both maternal use of acetaminophen and 
      children's neurodevelopment should be undertaken.
