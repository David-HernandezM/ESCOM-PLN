TI  - Clinical implementation of an AI-based prediction model for decision support for 
      patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.

AB  - Adverse outcomes after elective cancer surgery are a main contributor to 
      decreased survival, poorer oncological outcomes and increased healthcare costs. 
      Identifying high-risk patients and selecting interventions according to 
      individual risk profiles in the perioperative period in cancer surgery is a 
      challenge. Using real-world data on 18,403 patients with colorectal cancer from 
      Danish national registries and consecutive patients from a single center, we 
      developed, validated and implemented an artificial-intelligence-based risk 
      prediction model in clinical practice as a decision support tool for personalized 
      perioperative treatment. Personalized treatment pathways were designed according 
      to the predicted risk of 1-year mortality with the intensity of interventions 
      increasing with the predicted risk. The developed model had an area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 in the validation set. Results 
      from the nonrandomized before/after cohort study showed an incidence proportion 
      of the comprehensive complication index >20 of 19.1% in the personalized 
      treatment group versus 28.0% in the standard-of-care group, adjusted odds ratio 
      of 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.92; P = 0.02). The incidence of any 
      medical complication was 23.7% in the personalized treatment group and 37.3% in 
      the standard-of-care group; odds ratio of 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 
      0.36-0.76; P < 0.001). According to the short-term health economic modeling, 
      personalized perioperative treatment was cost effective. The study demonstrates a 
      fully scalable registry-based approach for using readily available data in an 
      artificial-intelligence-based decision support pipeline in clinical practice. Our 
      results indicate that this specific approach can be a cost-effective strategy to 
      improve key surgical clinical outcomes.
