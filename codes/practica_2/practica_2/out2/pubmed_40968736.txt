TI  - Association of Albumin Trajectories and Cumulative Exposure With In-Hospital 
      Mortality in Acute Pancreatitis: A Retrospective Cohort Study.
LID - 10.1097/JS9.0000000000003354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoalbuminemia is common in acute pancreatitis (AP) and associated 
      with poor outcomes, but its cumulative and dynamic impacts are not well 
      characterized. METHODS: This study included 3,214 AP patients (2005-2023). 
      Cumulative albumin exposure (CumALB) was calculated over the first 7 days using 
      the trapezoidal method. Latent class mixed modeling (LCMM) identified distinct 
      albumin trajectories. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic 
      splines (RCS) assessed associations between CumALB and in-hospital mortality. 
      Kaplan-Meier curves compared survival across trajectories. A simplified nomogram 
      was developed using predictors selected via Boruta and LASSO algorithms, with 
      performance assessed by AUC, calibration, and decision curves. Validation was 
      conducted in three cohorts: the MIMIC-IV database (n = 514), the eICU-CRD 
      database (n = 211), and the local cohort from 2024 (n = 880). RESULTS: Patients 
      in the lowest CumALB tertile had significantly higher mortality (11.0%) than 
      those in the highest tertile (1.3%, P<0.001). Each 1-SD increase in CumALB 
      reduced mortality risk by 42% (adjusted OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.44-0.76, P<0.001), 
      with RCS confirming a linear inverse relationship. CumALB outperformed single-day 
      albumin in mortality prediction. LCMM identified four trajectories; low-stable 
      (LS-T1) had highest mortality (17.7%), whereas low-increasing (LI-T4) had lower 
      mortality (8.6%). Compared with LS-T1, high-stable (HS-T2) and LI-T4 groups had 
      reduced risks (adjusted OR = 0.16 and 0.49, respectively; P<0.05). The 
      CumALB-based nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.836 in the training set (70%) and 
      0.864 in the internal test set (30%), outperforming APACHE II (AUC = 0.76), SIRS 
      (AUC = 0.72), Ranson (AUC = 0.72), and BISAP (AUC = 0.80). Validation was 
      conducted using three independent cohorts: the MIMIC-IV cohort (AUC = 0.631), the 
      eICU-CRD cohort (AUC = 0.681), and the local cohort from 2024 (AUC = 0.844). 
      Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the robustness of these results. 
      CONCLUSION: CumALB may provide a useful measure of the cumulative burden of 
      hypoalbuminemia in patients with acute pancreatitis, and albumin trajectories 
      could help capture its dynamic changes. The CumALB-based predictive model 
      demonstrated good performance in predicting mortality risk, potentially assisting 
      clinicians in early risk stratification and clinical decision-making for 
      high-risk patients within heterogeneous populations. However, prospective 
      validation is warranted before clinical implementation.
