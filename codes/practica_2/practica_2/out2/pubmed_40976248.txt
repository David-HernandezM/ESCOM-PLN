AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes remains an important health-care problem, with no 
      disease-modifying therapies available in people with recent-onset, clinical type 
      1 diabetes. Adaptive trial designs, allowing faster evaluation of treatment 
      modalities, remain underexplored in this stage of the disease. We aimed to 
      identify the minimum effective dose of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in people 
      aged 5-25 years with recent-onset, clinical type 1 diabetes. METHODS: MELD-ATG 
      was a phase 2, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-arm, adaptive 
      dose-ranging, parallel-cohort trial done in 14 accredited trial centres in eight 
      countries (the UK, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Italy, Belgium, Austria, and 
      Slovenia). Participants aged 5-25 years, diagnosed with clinical, stage 3 type 1 
      diabetes 3-9 weeks before treatment, with random C-peptide concentrations 0·2 
      nmol/L or more and at least one diabetes-related autoantibody (GADA, IA-2A, or 
      ZnT8) were randomly assigned by a web-based randomisation system into seven 
      consecutive cohorts receiving placebo, 2·5 mg/kg ATG, 1·5 mg/kg ATG, 0·5 mg/kg 
      ATG, or 0·1 mg/kg ATG. Participants in cohort 1 were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1:1, 
      participants in cohorts 2 and 3 were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1, and participants 
      in cohorts 4-7 were randomly assigned 1:1:1. All cohorts included one placebo 
      group and one 2·5 mg/kg ATG group. The other groups were assigned to ATG doses 
      that were determined based on accruing data and the decision of the dose 
      determining committee. The trial cohorts were stratified by age group (5-9 years, 
      10-17 years, and 18-25 years) with block sizes varying by cohort. Concealment 
      lists, outlining the treatment allocation, were only available for the 
      pharmacists; participants and study teams were masked to treatment allocation. 
      ATG was administered by an intravenous infusion over 2 consecutive days. The 
      primary outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) of the stimulated C-peptide 
      concentration during a 2-h mixed-meal tolerance test at 12 months measured as 
      ln(AUC C-peptide + 1). Conditional on finding a statistically significant 
      difference at p<0·05 for 2·5 mg/kg ATG versus placebo, the minimum effective dose 
      of ATG was determined. All randomly assigned participants were included in the 
      primary analysis. All participants who received the study drug were included in 
      the safety analysis. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04509791) 
      and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Nov 24, 2020, and Dec 13, 2023, 152 people 
      were recruited and screened, 117 of whom were randomly assigned (placebo n=31, 
      0·1 mg/kg ATG n=6, 0·5 mg/kg ATG n=35, 1·5 mg/kg ATG n=12, and 2·5 mg/kg n=33). 
      54 (46%) of 117 participants were male and 63 (54%) were female. Participants 
      were mainly European. The 0·1 mg/kg dose and the 1·5 mg/kg dose were 
      progressively dropped from the study. At 12 months, the mean ln(AUC 
      C-peptide + 1) was 0·411 nmol/L per min (SD 0·032) in the placebo group and 0·535 
      nmol/L per min (0·032) in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group. The mean difference in the 
      ln(AUC C-peptide + 1) between 2·5 mg/kg ATG and placebo was 0·124 nmol/L per min 
      (95% CI 0·043-0·205; p=0·0028). At 12 months, the mean ln(AUC C-peptide + 1) in 
      the 0·5 mg/kg ATG group, the remaining middle dose, was 0·513 nmol/L per min (SD 
      0·032), with a mean baseline-adjusted difference from placebo of 0·102 nmol/L per 
      min (95% CI 0·021-0·183; p=0·014). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 11 (33%) 
      of 33 participants in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group, eight (24%) of 34 in the 0·5mg/kg 
      ATG group, and no participants in the placebo group. Serum sickness occurred in 
      27 (82%) participants in the 2·5 mg/kg ATG group, 11 (32%) in the 0·5 mg/kg ATG 
      group, and no participants in the placebo group. There were no deaths related to 
      adverse events. INTERPRETATION: In young people with recent-onset, clinical type 
      1 diabetes, 2·5 mg/kg and 0·5 mg/kg ATG reduced loss of β-cell function, showing 
      the potential of an affordable, repurposed agent, ATG, in a low and safe dose, as 
      a disease-modifying agent in this population. FUNDING: The European Union's
