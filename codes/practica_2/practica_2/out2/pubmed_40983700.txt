TI  - Nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage promotes depressive behaviour in mice via 
      sex hormone degradation.

AB  - The human microbiome has a pronounced impact on human physiology and behaviour. 
      Despite its unique anatomical connection to the brain, the role of the nasal 
      microbiome in neurological diseases is understudied. Here, using human data and 
      experiments in mice, we show that nasal Staphylococcus aureus is linked to 
      depression. Nasal microbiome analyses revealed a positive correlation between 
      depression scores and S. aureus abundance among patients with depression and 
      healthy controls. Metabolomics of the nasal cavity showed decreased sex hormones, 
      estradiol and testosterone in patients with depression versus controls. Nasal 
      microbiota transplants from patients reproduced depression-like behaviour in mice 
      with differential abundance of S. aureus. Further homology and mutational 
      analysis uncovered an S. aureus sex hormone-degrading enzyme, 17b-hydroxysteroid 
      dehydrogenase (Hsd12), which degraded testosterone and estradiol in mice, leading 
      to lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the murine brain. These findings 
      reveal a nasal commensal that influences depressive behaviour and provides 
      insights into the nose-brain axis.
