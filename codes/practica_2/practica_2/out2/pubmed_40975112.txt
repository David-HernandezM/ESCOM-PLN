AB  - BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for youth-onset type 2 diabetes are limited 
      and have demonstrated lower glycaemic efficacy than those for adult-onset type 2 
      diabetes. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide, a 
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptor agonist, compared 
      with placebo in youth-onset type 2 diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre (39 sites), multinational (eight 
      countries) trial over 30 weeks, followed by an open-label extension for 22 weeks 
      in which all participants received tirzepatide. Participants aged 10 to <18 years 
      with youth-onset type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin and/or 
      basal insulin were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 
      or placebo administered by subcutaneous injection with a single-dose pen. 
      Randomisation was stratified by age group (≤14 years or >14 years) and 
      antihyperglycaemic medication use (metformin, basal insulin, or both). All 
      participants, investigators, and the sponsor were masked to treatment assignment 
      during the 30-week double-blind period. The primary endpoint was change in 
      glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) from baseline to week 30. Data from all 
      participants who received at least one dose of study drug were used to analyse 
      efficacy and safety. This completed trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
      (NCT05260021). FINDINGS: Between April 12, 2022, and Dec 27, 2023, 146 
      participants were screened, of whom 99 (60 [61%] female, 39 [39%] male; mean age 
      14·7 years [SD 1·8]; mean baseline HbA(1c) 8·04% [1·23]) were randomly assigned 
      to tirzepatide 5 mg (n=32), tirzepatide 10 mg (n=33), or placebo (n=34). At week 
      30, tirzepatide was superior to placebo in reducing HbA(1c), with a mean 
      reduction of 2·23% in the pooled tirzepatide group versus an increase of 0·05% in 
      the placebo group (estimated treatment difference -2·28%; 95% CI -2·87 to -1·69; 
      p<0·0001). Glycaemic efficacy was sustained up to 52 weeks with tirzepatide 
      treatment. Tirzepatide also resulted in significant reductions in BMI of 7·4% and 
      11·2% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively, compared with 0·4% in the 
      placebo group at 30 weeks. The most common adverse events with tirzepatide 
      treatment were gastrointestinal, all mild to moderate in severity, and decreased 
      over time. Two (6%) patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg group discontinued study 
      drug due to an adverse event. The safety profile of tirzepatide was consistent 
      with that reported in adults. No deaths were reported during the study period. 
      INTERPRETATION: Tirzepatide demonstrated significant improvements in glycaemic 
      control and BMI compared with placebo. These effects were sustained over 1 year.
