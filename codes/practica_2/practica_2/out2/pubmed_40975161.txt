AB  - Dysregulated ISC metabolism has been implicated in cancer progression, but its 
      role in LUAD pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting remains poorly understood. 
      Here, we demonstrate that ISC biogenesis is significantly upregulated in LUAD, 
      driven by transcription factors KLF15 and ZNF384, which activate GLRX5, LYRM4, 
      NFS1 and BOLA3 promoters. IL-1β promotes PCAF mitochondrial translocation, 
      releasing EP300 to amplify KLF15/ZNF384-mediated transcriptional activation. The 
      natural monoterpenoid Hinokitiol inhibits LUAD growth by disrupting 
      EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 interactions, suppressing ISC biogenesis gene expression and 
      inducing ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the membrane protein TMDD1, particularly 
      its cytoplasmic domain, promotes Hinokitiol's anti-tumor effects by facilitating 
      EP300-KLF15/ZNF384 dissociation and inhibiting ISC biogenesis. Remarkably, 
      Hinokitiol exhibits stage-dependent efficacy, with superior suppression of 
      metastatic (stage IV) tumors linked to heightened ferroptosis sensitivity. This 
      study not only elucidates the transcriptional machinery governing ISC biogenesis 
      in LUAD but also highlights Hinokitiol's dual mechanism as a promising 
      stage-specific therapeutic agent, offering novel strategies for advanced disease 
      management.
