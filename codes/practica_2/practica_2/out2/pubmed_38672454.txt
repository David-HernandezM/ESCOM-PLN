TI  - Roles of Epigenetics and Glial Cells in Drug-Induced Autism Spectrum Disorder.
LID - 10.3390/biom14040437 [doi]

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 
      severe deficits in social communication and interaction, repetitive movements, 
      abnormal focusing on objects, or activity that can significantly affect the 
      quality of life of the afflicted. Neuronal and glial cells have been implicated. 
      It has a genetic component but can also be triggered by environmental factors or 
      drugs. For example, prenatal exposure to valproic acid or acetaminophen, or 
      ingestion of propionic acid, can increase the risk of ASD. Recently, epigenetic 
      influences on ASD have come to the forefront of investigations on the etiology, 
      prevention, and treatment of this disorder. Epigenetics refers to DNA 
      modifications that alter gene expression without making any changes to the DNA 
      sequence. Although an increasing number of pharmaceuticals and environmental 
      chemicals are being implicated in the etiology of ASD, here, we specifically 
      focus on the molecular influences of the abovementioned chemicals on epigenetic 
      alterations in neuronal and glial cells and their potential connection to ASD. We 
      conclude that a better understanding of these phenomena can lead to more 
      effective interventions in ASD.
