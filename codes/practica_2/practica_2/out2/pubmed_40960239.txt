TI  - Orforglipron, an Oral Small-Molecule GLP-1 Receptor Agonist for Obesity 
      Treatment.
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2511774 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Orforglipron, a small-molecule, nonpeptide oral glucagon-like 
      peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, is being investigated as a treatment for 
      obesity. METHODS: In this phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind trial, 
      we examined the safety and efficacy of once-daily orforglipron at doses of 6 mg, 
      12 mg, or 36 mg, as compared with placebo (assigned in a 3:3:3:4 ratio) as an 
      adjunct to healthy diet and physical activity for 72 weeks. All the patients had 
      obesity without diabetes mellitus. The primary end point was the percent change 
      in body weight from baseline to week 72, as assessed according to the 
      treatment-regimen estimand in the intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: A total 
      of 3127 patients underwent randomization. The mean change in body weight from 
      baseline to week 72 was -7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], -8.2 to -6.8) with 6 
      mg of orforglipron, -8.4% (95% CI, -9.1 to -7.7) with 12 mg of orforglipron, and 
      -11.2% (95% CI, -12.0 to -10.4) with 36 mg of orforglipron, as compared with 
      -2.1% (95% CI, -2.8 to -1.4) with placebo (P<0.001 for all comparisons with 
      placebo). Among the patients in the orforglipron 36-mg group, 54.6% had a 
      reduction of 10% or more, 36.0% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a 
      reduction of 20% or more, as compared with 12.9%, 5.9%, and 2.8% of the patients, 
      respectively, in the placebo group. Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, 
      triglyceride levels, and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly improved with 
      orforglipron treatment as compared with placebo. Adverse events resulted in 
      treatment discontinuation in 5.3 to 10.3% of the patients in the orforglipron 
      groups and in 2.7% of those in the placebo group. The most common adverse events 
      with orforglipron were gastrointestinal effects, which were mostly mild to 
      moderate. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, 72-week treatment with 
      orforglipron led to significantly greater reductions in body weight than placebo; 
      the adverse-event profile was consistent with that of other GLP-1 receptor 
      agonists. (Funded by Eli Lilly; ATTAIN-1 ClinicalTrials.gov number,
