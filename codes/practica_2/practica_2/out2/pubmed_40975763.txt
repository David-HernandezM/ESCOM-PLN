AB  - BACKGROUND: Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent subtype 
      of renal cell carcinoma, and its prognosis in a metastatic stage is poor. 
      Although therapeutic options are continuously improving, better combination 
      therapies and individualized approaches are still needed. Reticulocalbin-1 
      (RCN1), located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is associated with 
      aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many solid tumors, but its role in ccRCC has 
      not been analyzed before. METHODS: In this study, we performed in-silico 
      transcriptomic data mining to analyze RCN1 expression at mRNA and protein levels 
      using large publicly available databases and conducted the first large-scale 
      cohort study on the impact of RCN1 in ccRCC, including data from 306 patients who 
      underwent tumor resection at the Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Bonn. We 
      examined the correlation of RCN1 expression with clinicopathological parameters 
      and overall survival. Additionally, we analyzed the association of RCN1 
      expression with CD8 T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. In vitro functional 
      analysis was performed by silencing RCN1 using siRNA in Caki-1 and A498 cell 
      lines to determine its role in tumor cell behavior. RESULTS: RCN1 is highly 
      expressed in ccRCC at both the mRNA and protein levels in public databases, which 
      was confirmed by our cohort data, where RCN1 was found to be highly and 
      homogenously expressed in 63.7% of ccRCCs. High RCN1 expression was associated 
      with shorter overall survival both at the mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein levels 
      (p = 0.01). Furthermore, high RCN1 expression was correlated with higher tumor 
      grade (p = 0.002), tumor stage (p = 0.036), presence of lymph node metastases 
      (p = 0.004), and distant metastases (p = 0.017). Clusters of macrophages tended 
      to correlate with RCN1 expression (p = 0.051), but no significant correlation was 
      found between RCN1 expression and the amount of CD8 T-lymphocytes. Additionally, 
      silencing RCN1 led to a significant reduction in tumor cell migration and 
      invasion. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that RCN1 is highly and homogenously 
      expressed in ccRCC and correlates with poor prognosis and unfavorable 
      clinicopathological parameters. RCN1 could serve as a reliable biomarker for 
      prognosis in ccRCC and shows potential as a target for therapeutic approaches.
