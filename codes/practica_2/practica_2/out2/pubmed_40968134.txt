AB  - Conventional antibiotic strategies often fail to consistently suppress escaping 
      planktonic bacteria and even induce antibiotic resistance, allowing 
      implant-associated infections (IAIs) to persist. In this study, we demonstrated 
      an antibiotic-free coating engineered with an herbal bioheterojunction featuring 
      a shell-in-shell structure where Cu(2)O forms the core, strontium (Sr) is loaded 
      in the inner shell, and curcumin (Cur) is nucleated in situ at the outer 
      heterointerface (Cu(2)O-Sr/Cur). Ultrasound-triggered reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) generation by the outer heterostructure (Cu(2)O/Cur), coupled with 
      Cu(I)-induced cuproptosis-like bacterial death, achieved antibacterial rates of 
      99.56% against S. aureus and 99.43% against E. coli. When ultrasonication ceases, 
      the released Cu(I) undergoes disproportionation reactions to form Cu(II), which 
      can chelate with Cur to form Cu-Cur metal complexes. These complexes exhibit 
      enhanced antioxidative properties through self-catalytic regulation, the 
      scavenging of ROS, and the activation of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage 
      phenotype. Moreover, strontium release from the inner shell simultaneously 
      suppressed osteoclast activity and promoted osteogenesis, resulting in trabecular 
      number and thickness increases of 129.03% and 56.71%, respectively, compared with 
      those in control group. Therefore, our work establishes a sequential treatment 
      strategy for the antibacterial properties and osteointegration ability of IAIs.
