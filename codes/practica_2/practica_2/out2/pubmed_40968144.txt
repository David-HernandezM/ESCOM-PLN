AB  - Genetic mutations cause hereditary deafness, in which mutations in the POU4 
      transcription factor 3 gene (POU4F3) lead to autosomal dominant non-syndromic 
      deafness 15 (DFNA15), for which no effective clinical treatment currently exists. 
      Gene editing holds promise for precisely repairing mutated nucleotides, thus 
      offering a potential cure for hereditary hearing loss. Here, we establish a 
      Pou4f3(WT/Q113*) mutant mouse model mimicking DFNA15. We develop and screen 
      adenine base editors (ABEs) targeting the Pou4f3(Q113*) allele by fusing diverse 
      adenine deaminases to Cas9 we discovered before. SchABE8e accomplishes highly 
      precise and efficient editing (up to 48.5%) at sgRNA3 in vitro. Neonatal 
      Pou4f3(WT/Q113*) mice are treated via synthetic AAV (Anc80L65)-delivered 
      SchABE8e-sgRNA3, resulting in near-complete hearing recovery, with the effect 
      persisting for at least four months. Biosafety analyses further support the 
      feasibility of base editing, providing a therapeutic strategy for DFNA15.
