AB  - Overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and therapeutic 
      resistance remains a significant challenge in ovarian cancer treatment. In this 
      study, a glutathione-responsive polymeric nanoparticle platform for the 
      co-delivery of the USP1 inhibitor SJB3-019A and the PARP inhibitor Niraparib is 
      developed. This system synergistically enhances DNA damage accumulation, 
      suppresses homologous recombination repair, and robustly activate the STING 
      signaling pathway, leading to enhanced type I interferon responses and mitigation 
      of immune evasion. Mechanistically, USP1 inhibition significantly impairs DNA 
      repair, amplifying the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibition and promoting 
      immunogenic cell death. In vivo studies demonstrated precise, 
      glutathione-responsive drug release and substantial tumor accumulation of the 
      nanoparticles, resulting in remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine ovarian 
      cancer models. Importantly, this combinational approach effectively remodels the 
      tumor microenvironment by increasing CD8⁺ T cell infiltration and enhancing tumor 
      sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. This innovative strategy 
      targeting DNA damage responses presents a promising platform for precise and 
      effective ovarian cancer immunotherapy.
