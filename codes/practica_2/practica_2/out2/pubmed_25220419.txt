AB  - The transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and maintenance of the 
      malignant state and phenotypes are associated with genetic and epigenetic 
      deregulations, altered cellular signaling responses and aberrant interactions 
      with the microenvironment. These alterations are constantly evolving as tumor 
      cells face changing selective pressures induced by the cells themselves, the 
      microenvironment and drug treatments. Tumors are also complex ecosystems where 
      different, sometime heterogeneous, subclonal tumor populations and a variety of 
      nontumor cells coexist in a constantly evolving manner. The interactions between 
      molecules and between cells that arise as a result of these alterations and 
      ecosystems are even more complex. The cancer research community is increasingly 
      embracing this complexity and adopting a combination of systems biology methods 
      and integrated analyses to understand and predictively model the activity of 
      cancer cells. Systems biology approaches are helping to understand the mechanisms 
      of tumor progression and design more effective cancer therapies. These approaches 
      work in tandem with rapid technological advancements that enable data acquisition 
      on a broader scale, with finer accuracy, higher dimensionality and higher 
      throughput than ever. Using such data, computational and mathematical models help 
      identify key deregulated functions and processes, establish predictive biomarkers 
      and optimize therapeutic strategies. Moving forward, implementing 
      patient-specific computational and mathematical models of cancer will 
      significantly improve the specificity and efficacy of targeted therapy, and will 
      accelerate the adoption of personalized and precision cancer medicine.
