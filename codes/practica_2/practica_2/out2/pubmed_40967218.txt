AB  - Given the evolutionary instinct for caloric intake and frequent weight rebound 
      after diet or drug cessation, increasing energy expenditure emerges as an 
      alternative obesity treatment. Environmental cues such as cold and seasonal light 
      prompt the brain to adjust energy expenditure, yet the coordinating neural 
      mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a hypothalamic GABAergic 
      neuronal subtype, marked by Crabp1, that targets multiple nuclei to regulate 
      energy expenditure in mice. Silencing Crabp1 neurons reduces physical activity, 
      body temperature, and adaptive thermogenesis, leading to obesity, whereas 
      activation increases energy expenditure and mitigates diet-induced obesity. 
      Structural and functional analyses reveal that Crabp1 neurons promote energy 
      metabolism through a "one-to-many" projection pattern. While Crabp1 neurons are 
      activated by cold exposure and physical activity, prolonged light exposure 
      abrogates their firing, which mediates light-induced metabolic disorder. 
      Together, we reveal a neural basis that integrates various physiological and 
      environmental stimuli to control energy expenditure and body weight.
