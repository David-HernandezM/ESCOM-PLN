TI  - Epigenetic imprinting in innate lymphoid cell precursors directs the lineage 
      segregation of innate lymphoid cells.

AB  - Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are essential for mucosal homeostasis, but the 
      epigenetic regulation of their lineage segregation remains elusive. Here we 
      simultaneously profiled the single-cell DNA methylome, chromatin accessibility 
      and transcriptome of ILC subsets and ILC precursors (ILCPs) and found that ILCPs 
      could be divided into two subgroups (ILCP1 and ILCP2). ILCP2s had highly 
      heterogeneous DNA methylation profiles and could be divided into three groups 
      according to their DNA methylation characteristics, which matched those of ILC 
      subsets. We identified the signature methylation regions (SMRs) of each ILC 
      subset and traced the DNA methylation imprinting during ILCP differentiation. 
      ILCP2s with hypomethylated SMRs characteristic of ILC subsets differentiated into 
      those subsets. DNA methylation editing of SMRs suppressed ILC lineage 
      segregation, while deletion of Dnmt1 in ILCPs abrogated the heterogeneous 
      distribution of SMRs and resulted in ILC differentiation defects. These findings 
      provide evidence that epigenetic imprinting determines lineage segregation during 
      immune cell development.
