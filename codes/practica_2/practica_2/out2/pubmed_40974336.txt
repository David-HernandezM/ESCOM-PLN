AB  - OBJECTIVE: China faces a significant burden of gastrointestinal tumors driven by 
      socioeconomic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Using GBD2021 data, this 
      study analyses epidemiological trends and disease burden for six major 
      gastrointestinal tumor cancers (esophagus, gastric, colorectum, liver, pancreas, 
      gallbladder and biliary tract) in China (1990-2021). METHODS: The GBD 2021 was 
      used to extract the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years 
      (DALYs) data of gastrointestinal tumors in China. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) 
      and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated. Temporal trends were 
      assessed by joinpoint regression analysis, and average annual percent change 
      (AAPC) and annual percentage change (APC) were calculated and analyzed stratified 
      by gender and age group. RESULTS: In 2021, China recorded 1.96 million new 
      gastrointestinal cancer cases, with 1.35 million deaths and 33.07 million DALYs. 
      Gastric cancer led in mortality, and colorectal cancer demonstrated the most 
      rapid incidence growth (AAPC = 1.68). Significant reductions were observed in 
      gastric cancer age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) (AAPC = -2.44) and 
      esophageal cancer age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates (ASDR) 
      (AAPC = -2.31). Gender disparities were particularly pronounced in esophageal 
      cancer, with the male-to-female mortality ratio (M/F) escalating from 2.50 (1990) 
      to 4.12 (2021). The age group with the highest mortality burden was 70-74, while 
      the age group with the most significant loss of DALYs was 65-69. CONCLUSION: 
      China has significantly reduced gastrointestinal cancer burden, but gender and 
      age disparities persist, necessitating targeted interventions. Future efforts 
      should focus on tertiary prevention for high-risk groups, especially males and 
      the elderly, while enhancing molecular subtyping and regional data stratification 
      for precision cancer control.
