AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage and MRI biomarkers of 
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy have a greater risk of recurrent intracerebral 
      haemorrhage than patients without these biomarkers. However, access to MRI is 
      limited. We aimed to determine whether the Edinburgh CT-only and CT-APOE 
      diagnostic criteria for cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related lobar intracerebral 
      haemorrhage are associated with recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. METHODS: We 
      did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from cohort studies identified at 
      the 2018 International cerebral amyloid angiopathy conference in Lille, France, 
      assessing patients with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage with available diagnostic 
      CT imaging that had been, or could be, rated for the Edinburgh cerebral amyloid 
      angiopathy criteria imaging features, and with follow-up data for recurrent 
      intracerebral haemorrhage and death. Eligible patients were aged 16 years or 
      older with first or recurrent spontaneous lobar intracerebral haemorrhage 
      diagnosed by non-contrast brain CT, with no evidence of an underlying cause other 
      than cerebral small vessel disease. Collaborators provided individual 
      patient-level data. The primary outcome was first recurrent intracerebral 
      haemorrhage occurring at least 30 days after the index event, analysed using 
      primary two-stage (cohort-level) and secondary one-stage (pooled) meta-analyses 
      with multivariable regression models with a competing risk of death, adjusted for 
      age, sex, and CT small vessel disease score. Pooled analyses were adjusted for 
      previous intracerebral haemorrhage, dementia, hypertension, and cohort 
      clustering. All analyses were done in R Project for Statistical Computing 
      (version 4.5.0). FINDINGS: We included eight cohorts from Austria, France, 
      Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA, with 1705 eligible patients for the CT-only 
      criteria. In the primary two-stage meta-analysis of the CT-only criteria (562 
      patients from three European cohorts, median age 76 years [IQR 68-82], 282 [50%] 
      female and 280 [50%] male), 69 patients had a recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage 
      over 1381 person-years' follow-up. The proportion with recurrent intracerebral 
      haemorrhage during 5-year follow-up in the intermediate-risk and high-risk 
      CT-only cerebral amyloid angiopathy criteria group was 48 (16%) of 307 patients 
      compared with 21 (8%) of 255 patients in the low-risk group (adjusted 
      sub-distribution hazard ratio [HR] 1·79, 95% CI 1·05-3·05, p=0·032). In the 
      one-stage meta-analysis of the CT-only criteria (1620 patients with lobar 
      intracerebral haemorrhage from eight cohorts, median age 73 years [IQR 62-80], 
      763 [47%] female and 857 [53%] male), 171 patients had a recurrent intracerebral 
      haemorrhage over 3208 person-years' follow-up. Cumulative 5-year incidence of 
      recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage in the low-risk CT-only cerebral amyloid 
      angiopathy criteria group was 45 (12%) of 727 patients compared with 54 (16%) of 
      513 patients in the intermediate-risk group (adjusted sub-distribution HR 1·68, 
      95% CI 1·21-2·32; p=0·0018), and 72 (26%) of 380 patients in the high-risk group 
      (adjusted sub-distribution HR 2·97, 1·50-5·89, p=0·0018). We included six cohorts 
      with 1021 eligible patients for the CT-APOE criteria; 15 patients with missing 
      baseline data were excluded. There were insufficient outcomes in individual 
      CT-APOE cohorts to do the two-stage meta-analysis. In the one-stage meta-analysis 
      of the CT-APOE criteria (1006 patients, median age 71 years [IQR 58-79, 477 [47%] 
      female and 529 [53%] male), 74 patients had a recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage 
      over 1495 person-years' follow-up. Cumulative 3-year incidence of recurrent 
      intracerebral haemorrhage was 34 (15%) of 320 patients in the high-risk CT-APOE 
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy criteria group versus 14 (8%) of 322 patients in the 
      low-risk group (adjusted sub-distribution HR 2·22 [95% CI 1·36-3·61], p=0·0014). 
      INTERPRETATION: The Edinburgh CT-only and CT-APOE diagnostic criteria for 
      cerebral amyloid angiopathy-associated lobar intracerebral haemorrhage were 
      associated with a greater incidence of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. These 
      findings could aid personalised prediction and targeted secondary prevention in 
      standard clinical practice where brain CT is available. FUNDING: UK Medical
