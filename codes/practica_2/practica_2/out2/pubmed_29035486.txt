BTI - Global Health Research in an Unequal World: Ethics Case Studies from Africa
AB  - This book is a collection of fictionalised case studies of everyday ethical 
      dilemmas and challenges, encountered in the process of conducting global health 
      research in places where the effects of global, political and economic inequality 
      are particularly evident. It is a training tool to fill the gap between research 
      ethics guidelines, and their implementation 'on the ground'. The case studies, 
      therefore, focus on 'relational' ethics: ethical actions and ideas that emerge 
      through relations with others, rather than in regulations.
