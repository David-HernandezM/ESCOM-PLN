AB  - Heterochromatic domains of DNA account for a large fraction of mammalian genomes 
      and play critical roles in silencing transposons and genes, but the mechanisms 
      that establish and maintain these domains are not fully understood. Here, we use 
      a CRISPR-based genetic screen to investigate the requirements for establishment 
      and maintenance of histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) heterochromatin. 
      In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we show that transiently induced H3K9me3 
      heterochromatin is inherited for a limited number of cell divisions, 
      independently of sequence-dependent recruitment, but becomes stable upon 
      differentiation, concomitant with downregulation of enzymes erasing H3K9me and 
      DNA methylation. In addition, ordered and non-redundant activities of multiple 
      H3K9 and DNA methyltransferases, together with histone deacetylases, chromatin 
      remodeling complexes, and RNA processing factors, are required for 
      heterochromatin maintenance. Our findings suggest that a newly acquired H3K9me3 
      domain can be maintained like an imprint but requires reinforcement by DNA 
      methylation and other pathways.
