      Intellectual Disability.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Several studies suggest that acetaminophen (paracetamol) use during 
      pregnancy may increase risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children. If true, 
      this would have substantial implications for management of pain and fever during 
      pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of acetaminophen use during 
      pregnancy with children's risk of autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This nationwide cohort study with sibling control analysis included a 
      population-based sample of 2 480 797 children born in 1995 to 2019 in Sweden, 
      with follow-up through December 31, 2021. EXPOSURE: Use of acetaminophen during 
      pregnancy prospectively recorded from antenatal and prescription records. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability based on 
      International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International 
      Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes in health registers. RESULTS: In 
      total, 185 909 children (7.49%) were exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy. 
      Crude absolute risks at 10 years of age for those not exposed vs those exposed to 
      acetaminophen were 1.33% vs 1.53% for autism, 2.46% vs 2.87% for ADHD, and 0.70% 
      vs 0.82% for intellectual disability. In models without sibling control, ever-use 
      vs no use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was associated with marginally 
      increased risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]; risk 
      difference [RD] at 10 years of age, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.01% to 0.20%]), ADHD (HR, 
      1.07 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10]; RD, 0.21% [95% CI, 0.08%-0.34%]), and intellectual 
      disability (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.00-1.10]; RD, 0.04% [95% CI, -0.04% to 0.12%]). 
      To address unobserved confounding, matched full sibling pairs were also analyzed. 
      Sibling control analyses found no evidence that acetaminophen use during 
      pregnancy was associated with autism (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.93-1.04]; RD, 0.02% 
      [95% CI, -0.14% to 0.18%]), ADHD (HR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.94-1.02]; RD, -0.02% [95% 
      CI, -0.21% to 0.15%]), or intellectual disability (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.92-1.10]; 
      RD, 0% [95% CI, -0.10% to 0.13%]). Similarly, there was no evidence of a 
      dose-response pattern in sibling control analyses. For example, for autism, 
      compared with no use of acetaminophen, persons with low (<25th percentile), 
      medium (25th-75th percentile), and high (>75th percentile) mean daily 
      acetaminophen use had HRs of 0.85, 0.96, and 0.88, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with children's 
      risk of autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability in sibling control analysis. 
      This suggests that associations observed in other models may have been 
      attributable to familial confounding.
