AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a leading global health challenge, yet the role of 
      Social Determinants of Health (SDH) in shaping depression risk - particularly 
      through underlying biological mechanisms - remains insufficiently understood. 
      This study leverages a multi-omics approach to explore how unfavorable social 
      conditions influence depression through neural, and physiological pathways. 
      METHODS: Drawing on data from 257,698 participants in the UK Biobank. Cox 
      proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the relationship 
      between SDH, polygenic risk scores (PRS), and depression. Correlation analyses 
      were conducted to explore associations between SDH, biomarkers, brain structure, 
      and depression. Two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) was applied to 
      investigate causal relationships, while structural equation modeling (SEM) was 
      used to examine interactions among SDH, depression, brain structure, PRS, and 
      immune-metabolic biomarkers. RESULTS: Depression was significantly associated 
      with SDH. Multivariable Cox regression showed that unfavorable SDH increased 
      depression risk (HR = 1.916), and higher PRS was also linked to increased risk 
      (HR = 1.288). The combination of unfavorable SDH and high PRS yielded the highest 
      depression risk (HR = 2.578). MR analysis further emphasized the causal 
      relationship between unfavorable SDH and depression. SDH was also linked to brain 
      structural changes and metabolic markers, with smaller brain volumes in regions 
      like the hippocampus and insula in the unfavorable SDH group, along with 
      associations with biomarkers such as triglycerides and C-reactive protein. SEM 
      analysis revealed that SDH influenced depression through immune-metabolic and 
      brain structural pathways. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the 
      multifaceted nature of depression, highlighting how social disadvantage becomes 
      biologically embedded through genetic and physiological mechanisms. Addressing 
      key modifiable components of SDH may represent a powerful strategy for targeted 
      prevention, especially in genetically at-risk populations.
