AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety 
      and to identify factors associated with these conditions among caregivers of 
      children and adolescents with epilepsy attending the paediatric neurology clinic 
      at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Tanzania. DESIGN: A hospital-based 
      cross-sectional study. SETTING: The paediatric neurology clinic of a national 
      referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: 427 caregivers of 
      children with epilepsy (CWE) were consecutively enrolled. Eligibility criteria 
      included being 18 years or older and having provided care for the child for at 
      least 6 months. Caregivers unable to read and write in Swahili or previously 
      diagnosed with a mental illness before assuming the caregiving role were 
      excluded. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were the 
      prevalence of depression (assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 
      (PHQ-9), cut-off ≥10), anxiety (assessed with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 
      tool (GAD-7), cut-off ≥10), and their co-occurrence. Secondary outcomes were the 
      factors associated with these conditions, analysed using logistic regression and 
      reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). RESULTS: Depression was observed in 74 
      (17.3%, 95% CI: 13.8 to 21.3) participants and anxiety was found in 74 caregivers 
      (17.3%,95% CI: 14.1 to 20.8). 38 (9.0%, 95% CI: 6.3 to 11.7) participants had 
      concurrent depression and anxiety. Factors associated with depression were having 
      a child: less than 5 years old (adjusted OR (aOR)=6.56, p=0.012), epilepsy 
      duration of more than 5 years (aOR=2.80, p=0.048), history of epilepsy-related 
      injuries (aOR=2.64, p=0.015) and three or more admissions (aOR=2.56, p=0.046). 
      Caregivers whose children had not started school or were in primary school had 
      lower odds of depression compared with counterparts in secondary school 
      (aOR=0.02, p=0.003) and (aOR=0.03, p=0.005), respectively. Caregivers' anxiety 
      was associated with having a child with: another comorbidity (aOR=1.93, p=0.020), 
      a history of epilepsy-related injuries (aOR=2.37, p=0.030), three or more 
      admissions (aOR=2.98, p=0.015) and caregiver age between 41 to 50 years 
      (aOR=3.06, p=0.042). CONCLUSION: Depression and anxiety are prevalent among 
      caregivers of CWE. The findings indicate a need for the integration of mental 
      health services within paediatric neurology clinics to support caregiver 
      well-being.
