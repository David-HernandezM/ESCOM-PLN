TI  - Once-daily oral icotrokinra versus placebo and once-daily oral deucravacitinib in 
      participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 & 2): two 
      phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-23 and interleukin-12 are 
      efficacious in treating plaque psoriasis but must be delivered via intravenous or 
      subcutaneous injection. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
      icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113), a targeted oral peptide that selectively binds the 
      interleukin-23 receptor, compared with both placebo and deucravacitinib in adults 
      with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. METHODS: The phase 3, randomised, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-comparator-controlled ICONIC-ADVANCE 
      1 and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 trials, which are being done at 149 sites across 13 
      countries and 114 sites across 11 countries, respectively, randomly assigned 
      (2:1:2 and 4:1:4, respectively) adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis 
      diagnosed for at least 26 weeks (body-surface-area involvement ≤10%, Psoriasis 
      Area and Severity Index [PASI] ≤12, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] 
      ≤3) to once-daily oral icotrokinra 200 mg, placebo, or deucravacitinib 6 mg; 
      participants randomly assigned to placebo or deucravacitinib transitioned to 
      icotrokinra at week 16 or week 24, respectively. Coprimary endpoints were 
      proportions of participants achieving IGA 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin) 
      with at least a two-grade improvement and at least 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 
      90) at week 16 with icotrokinra versus placebo. These studies are registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06143878 (ADVANCE 1) and NCT06220604 (ADVANCE 2), and are 
      ongoing. FINDINGS: ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 enrolled participants from Jan 17, 2024, to 
      May 24, 2024, and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 enrolled participants from March 9, 2024, to 
      June 13, 2024. Participants (ADVANCE 1: 774 of 988 patients screened; ADVANCE 2: 
      731 of 917 patients screened) were randomly assigned to icotrokinra (n=311 and 
      322), placebo (n=156 and 82), or deucravacitinib (n=307 and 327). All coprimary 
      endpoints were met in both trials. Higher proportions of icotrokinra-treated 
      versus placebo-treated participants achieved IGA 0 or 1 (ADVANCE 1: 213 [68%] of 
      311 vs 17 [11%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 58% [50-64]; ADVANCE 2: 227 
      [70%] of 322 vs seven [9%] of 82, 62% [53-69]; both p<0·0001) and PASI 90 
      (ADVANCE 1: 171 [55%] of 311 vs six [4%] of 156, treatment difference 95% CI 51% 
      [44-57]; ADVANCE 2: 184 [57%] of 322 vs one [1%] of 82, 56% [48-62]; both 
      p<0·0001) at week 16. Across studies, adverse event rates to week 16 were 303 
      (48%) of 632 and 136 (57%) of 237 with icotrokinra and placebo, respectively; the 
      most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (37 [6%] of 632 and 13 [5%] of 
      237) and upper respiratory tract infection (23 [4%] of 632 and eight [3%] of 
      237). To week 24, adverse event rates were lower than with icotrokinra (359 [57%] 
      of 632) than deucravacitinib (411 [65%] of 634). INTERPRETATION: Icotrokinra 
      showed superior clinical response rates versus placebo and deucravacitinib in 
      phase 3 moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis trials, with similar adverse event 
      rates to placebo. These findings suggest the potential of once-daily oral 
      icotrokinra to provide robust efficacy and a favourable safety profile. FUNDING:
