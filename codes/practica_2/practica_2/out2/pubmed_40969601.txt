AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke risk associated with the triglyceride-glucose index-body mass 
      index (TyG-BMI) has been increasingly recognized. Depression has also been firmly 
      established as a factor related to the development of stroke. However, there 
      remains a research gap in evaluating the combined effect of TyG-BMI and 
      depression on the risk of stroke. This study aims to address the inconsistency 
      between TyG-BMI, depression, and stroke incidence. METHODS: This study utilized 
      longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study 
      (CHARLS), involving 6,417 participants, and the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (NHANES) database, which included data from 17,754 
      participants. The analytical approach involved applying Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis to assess the risk of stroke with the combined evaluation of 
      TyG-BMI and depression. Additionally, we conducted smoothing curve fitting, 
      subgroup analysis, interaction tests, and predictive modeling for further 
      evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 24,171 participants from two national cohorts 
      were included in the analysis. Among them, 1,223 individuals had a history of 
      stroke. Compared to individuals with lower TyG-BMI and no depression, those with 
      higher TyG-BMI and depression exhibited a significantly higher risk of stroke. 
      The restricted cubic spline (RCS) model indicated that the combination of 
      elevated TyG-BMI and depression had a strong predictive value for stroke 
      occurrence. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest a positive interaction 
      between TyG-BMI and depression in predicting stroke risk. The combined evaluation 
      of TyG-BMI and depression should be emphasized to enhance primary prevention 
      efforts for stroke.
