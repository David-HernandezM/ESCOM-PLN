TI  - Cardiovascular effects of incretin-based drugs in patients with and without a 
      history of heart failure: a protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis and 
      trial sequential analysis of randomised controlled trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Incretin-based drugs, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
      receptor agonists (RAs) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide 
      (GIP)/GLP-1 RAs, are increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus and obesity. While these agents have shown cardiovascular benefits, 
      their effects on both cardiovascular outcomes and cardiac structure and function 
      remain uncertain-particularly in patients with and without a history of heart 
      failure (HF). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a systematic review and 
      search major medical databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 
      (CENTRAL), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), 
      Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences 
      Literature (LILACS), Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) and 
      Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S)), as well as clinical 
      trial registries from their inception and onwards to identify relevant randomised 
      trials. The literature search is scheduled for July 2025. Two review authors will 
      independently extract data and assess risk of bias. We will include randomised 
      controlled trials assessing the effects of cagrilintide/semaglutide, liraglutide, 
      semaglutide and tirzepatide in patients with and without a history of HF. The 
      primary outcome will be cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes will include 
      HF hospitalisation, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart rate, systolic blood 
      pressure, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, left ventricular ejection 
      fraction, left ventricular end-diastolic volume and left ventricular end-systolic 
      volume. Data will be synthesised by aggregate data meta-analyses and trial 
      sequential analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
      tool, version 2, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed by Grading of 
      Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE). ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: As this study is a systematic review based on secondary analysis 
      of published data, ethical approval is not required. Findings will be published 
      in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:
