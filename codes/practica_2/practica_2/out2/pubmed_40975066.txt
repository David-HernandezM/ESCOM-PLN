AB  - Advanced pancreatic cancer presents dismal survival with limited effective, 
      well-tolerated options beyond chemotherapy. This phase 1 trial evaluates the 
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bivalent IAP antagonist APG-1387 with 
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (AG) in patients failing or intolerant to standard 
      care. In 28-day cycles, patients receive intravenous infusions of APG-1387 (20, 
      30, or 45 mg) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m(2)) and 
      gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, and 15, with dose-limiting toxicity 
      (DLT) as the primary endpoint per NCI CTCAE v5.0. Of 28 screened, 21 are 
      enrolled; one grade 4 DLT recovers within 3 days, and 9 (42.9%) experience grade 
      ≥3 treatment-related adverse events, mostly AG-related bone marrow toxicities. 
      Among 15 efficacy-evaluable patients, 3 achieve partial responses, including 1 
      (33%) without prior AG. APG-1387 with AG demonstrates tolerability and 
      encouraging posterior-line antitumor effects in AG-naive patients (NCT04643405).
