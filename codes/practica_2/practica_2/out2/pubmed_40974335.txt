TI  - Telomerase modRNA Offers a Novel RNA-Based Approach to Treat Human Pulmonary 
      Fibrosis.

AB  - Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) is a life-threatening illness that is characterized by 
      progressive scarring in the lung interstitium. There is an urgent need for new PF 
      therapies because current treatments only slow down the progression of fibrosis, 
      and the median life expectancy post-diagnosis is only 4-6 years. Since PF 
      patients frequently exhibit telomere attrition, overexpressing telomerase, the 
      enzyme responsible for synthesizing telomeres, represents a compelling 
      therapeutic option. In this study, we in vitro transcribed human telomerase 
      reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA using modified nucleosides (modRNA). ModRNA 
      hTERT treatment led to transient activation of telomerase activity in a 
      dose-dependent manner in MRC-5 cells and, importantly, in primary human alveolar 
      type II pneumocytes. Consequently, the proliferative capacity was increased, 
      concomitant with reduced DNA damage and elongated telomere length. Notably, the 
      induction of cellular immune response was only detectable at the highest modRNA 
      concentration and returned to normal levels within 48 h. Next, we demonstrated 
      that circularized, exonuclease-resistant modRNA hTERT extended the transient 
      expression profile, which may be clinically advantageous. Finally, we provided 
      therapeutic proof of concept in organotypic 3D ex vivo human precision-cut lung 
      slices derived from end-stage PF patients. Intriguingly, a single modRNA hTERT 
      treatment inhibited senescence, as indicated by significantly lower levels of 
      senescence-associated β-galactosidase. Pro-inflammatory markers (IL6 and IL8) 
      and, concurrently, the key fibrosis mediators TGFβ and COL1A1 were markedly 
      reduced after modRNA and circular RNA hTERT treatment. In conclusion, the data 
      presented herein provide initial evidence for the potential of RNA-based hTERT 
      therapy for treating human lung fibrosis.
