TI  - Staging Alzheimer's disease through amyloid and tau PET.

AB  - A workgroup assembled by the Alzheimer's Association recently described a 
      conceptual framework for Alzheimer's disease biological staging based on amyloid 
      and tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, specific tau PET cut 
      points were left to be determined, a step necessary prior to clinical 
      application. We sought to operationalize and evaluate Alzheimer's disease 
      biological staging by identifying meaningful tau PET cut points to define the 
      four biological stages in a well-characterized participant cohort and describe 
      the features of individuals placed into the different biological stages. The 
      primary analysis included 896 participants in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging or 
      the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center longitudinal cohorts. A 
      validation cohort consisted of 328 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Neuroimaging Initiative. Both cognitively normal and impaired individuals with 
      positive amyloid PET and evaluable tau PET imaging were included. Tau PET cut 
      points were identified with Gaussian Mixture Models to characterize Alzheimer's 
      disease biological stage in study participants with different clinical diagnoses 
      and objective degrees of cognitive impairment as measured by Mini-Mental State 
      Examination. A tau PET cut point in the medial temporal region and two cut points 
      in the temporoparietal region were identified to collectively produce the four 
      Alzheimer's disease biological stages described in the revised criteria. 
      Increasing stage was associated with greater likelihood of mild cognitive 
      impairment and dementia diagnosis and worsening cognitive performance on 
      Mini-Mental State Examination and Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes, a result 
      that was reproduced in the independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative cohort. This study provided empiric validation for the concept of 
      using amyloid PET and tau PET to separate subjects with biomarker-proven 
      Alzheimer's disease into four biological stages with distinct characteristics.
