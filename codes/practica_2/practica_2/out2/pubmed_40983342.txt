      PD-L1 degradation in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent malignancy and the 
      third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as first-line therapies for advanced HCC, 
      substantially improving clinical outcomes. However, resistance to ICIs remains a 
      major therapeutic challenge. Lactylation, a recently identified 
      post-translational modification, has been implicated in tumor progression, 
      although its role in ICIs resistance in HCC remains unclear. METHODS: 
      Cytotoxicity assays, flow cytometry and orthotopic HCC mouse model were used to 
      evaluate the effects of lactylation in remodeling the immune microenvironment. 
      Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing were employed to 
      identify lactylation-regulated gene profiles. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 
      (PD-L1) protein degradation was assayed by cycloheximide-chase analysis and 
      ubiquitination assay. Interactions between major vault protein (MVP) and 
      β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) were analyzed by 
      co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Site-directed mutagenesis and truncation 
      mutants were designed to determine binding sites of MVP-β-TrCP complex. RESULTS: 
      Elevated lactylation correlates with poor prognosis and ICIs resistance in 
      patients with HCC. Inhibition of lactylation enhances CD8(+) T-cell infiltration 
      and cytokine production. Multiomics analyses identify MVP as a 
      lactylation-regulated factor that suppresses CD8(+) T cell-mediated antitumor 
      immunity. Elevated MVP expression is associated with resistance to checkpoint 
      blockade therapy. Mechanistic studies reveal that histone lactylation-induced MVP 
      upregulation stabilizes PD-L1 by preventing β-TrCP-mediated proteasomal 
      degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of lactylation restores ICIs sensitivity 
      in orthotopic HCC mouse models. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that 
      histone lactylation promotes ICIs resistance via MVP-dependent PD-L1 
      stabilization. Therefore, targeting lactylation in combination with programmed 
      cell death protein-1/PD-L1 blockade offers a promising strategy to overcome 
      immunotherapy resistance in HCC.
