TI  - A novel lncRNA, lncMCL1, modulates neural pyroptosis associated with epilepsy via 
      stabilizing DDX3X.

AB  - Pyroptosis is strongly associated with refractory epilepsy. However, the 
      underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Increasing evidence has shown 
      that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in various neurological disorder 
      processes by regulating programmed cell death. In this study, we identified a 
      novel lncRNA, lncMCL1, by high-throughput screening, which suppresses NLRP3 
      inflammasome-dependent neural pyroptosis in epilepsy. We demonstrated that 
      lncMCL1 is aberrantly underexpressed in the hippocampus and cortex of epilepsy 
      patients, a phenomenon that was validated in various mouse and rat epilepsy 
      models. Through CRISPR/Cas9, siRNA, and viral manipulation, gain- and 
      loss-of-function experiments confirmed that lncMCL1 inhibits neuronal pyroptosis 
      in vivo and in vitro and exerts antiepileptic effects. Mechanistically, lncMCL1 
      acts as a scaffold to modulate DDX3X protein stabilization by enhancing 
      NEDD4-mediated DDX3X K48 ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting neural pyroptosis 
      through the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. Additionally, 
      IL-18/IL-1β, downstream cytokines of pyroptosis, inhibit lncMCL1 expression 
      through the activation of a shared pathway, the STAT3 pathway, forming a feedback 
      loop. Our findings identify lncMCL1 as a critical regulator of neural cell 
      pyroptosis and a promising therapeutic target for refractory epilepsy.
