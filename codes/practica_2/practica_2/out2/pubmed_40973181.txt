AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain malignancies originating from the central nervous system and 
      metastasizing from extracerebral tumors remain incurable, while the underlying 
      mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the 
      pan-brain tumor microenvironment. METHODS: We employed transgenic mice, 
      stereotactic brain injections, flow cytometry, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, 
      immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, 
      co-immunoprecipitation, DNA pulldown assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. 
      RESULTS: We constructed single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome 
      profiles of pan-brain tumors and identified the enhanced hypoxia-inducible factor 
      1 (HIF-1) signaling in the intracerebral metastases compared with extracerebral 
      parts, as well as in mesenchymal-subtype glioblastomas. Hypoxic adaptability 
      mediated by HIF-1 signaling confers a tumor growth advantage in the brain. 
      Integrated analysis and experimental models revealed the co-localization and 
      mutual dependence between brain tumor hypoxic adaptability and macrophage 
      infiltration. Hypoxic adaptive tumor cells recruit macrophages via galectin 1 
      (LGALS1) and induce differentiation toward the secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) + 
      subpopulation via lactate mediated histone lactylation. SPP1 directly activates 
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in tumor cells to promote tumor 
      growth and inhibits the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. Genetic SPP1 
      deficiency in macrophages delays hypoxic adaptive tumor growth in the brain and 
      enhances the tumor response to anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy. 
      Preclinically, targeting lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by stiripentol with 
      blood-brain barrier permeability impedes brain tumor progression and synergizes 
      with anti-PD-1 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The interrelationship between hypoxic 
      adaptive tumor cells and macrophages in the brain highlights the possibility of 
      SPP1+ macrophage-based microenvironment remodeling in brain tumor therapy.
