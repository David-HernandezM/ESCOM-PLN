AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological aging, defined as the biological age (BA) or phenotypic 
      age (PA) exceeding the chronological age (CA), is a key indicator of premature 
      aging. Obesity accelerates aging; however, the effect of Body Roundness Index 
      (BRI), an indicator of abdominal obesity, combined with sex or Ascorbic acid 
      (Asc), on biological aging remains unclear. This study examined the association 
      between BRI and biological aging, its interaction with sex and Asc intake, and 
      its mediating mechanisms. METHODS: Data from the 1999-2018 U.S. National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) formed the basis of this study. 
      Biological aging is characterized by BA or PA surpassing CA. Association between 
      the BRI and biological aging was evaluated using multivariable-adjusted weighted 
      regression. To assess for nonlinearity, restricted cubic splines were utilized, 
      while interactions were investigated through both additive and multiplicative 
      analyses. The bootstrap method was used to examine the potential mediating 
      effects of biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and protective 
      pathways. RESULTS: The final analysis included 14,337 U.S. adults (mean age 
      47.5 years; 50.27% women). A total of 49.32% of the participants showed signs of 
      biological aging, with BRI being positively associated with biological aging in a 
      nonlinear manner, including a threshold effect. The increase in the risk per BRI 
      unit was more significant in women, and high doses of Asc reduced the risk of 
      biological aging associated with increased BRI. Mediation analysis indicated that 
      the association between BRI and accelerated aging was partly mediated by 
      metabolic dysfunction (mediated by the triglyceride-glucose index [18.73%] and by 
      triglycerides [9.21%], oxidative stress mediated by uric acid [17.92%] and by 
      white blood cell count [5.80%], and depletion of protective factors mediated by 
      vitamin D [- 3.85%] and by high-density lipoprotein [- 4.24%]). A sensitivity 
      analysis confirmed the reliability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: A higher BRI 
      showed a nonlinear positive association with accelerated biological aging, a 
      relationship that appears to be modified by female sex and Asc intake. Clinical 
      approaches targeting metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and antioxidant and 
      vasoprotective reserves may help combat obesity-related aging. BRI thresholds 
      enable early identification of individuals at high risk for personalized 
      interventions.
