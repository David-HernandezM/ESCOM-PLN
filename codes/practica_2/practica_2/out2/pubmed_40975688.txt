AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic pain, frequently report cognitive problems 
      ('brain fog'), particulary those with nociplastic pain, which involves 
      dysregulated pain processing. However, the association with objective executive 
      dysfunction and decline over time is unclear. We examined whether nociplastic 
      pain severity is associated with executive dysfunction and decline, and explored 
      which factors, such as sex or associated non-pain symptoms, mediate this 
      relationship. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study using UK Biobank. 
      Baseline cognitive assessments (2017-20), a pain questionnaire (2019), and 
      follow-up cognitive assessments (2021-2) were analysed. Nociplastic pain severity 
      was measured using the fibromyalgia index (0-31), a continuous measure of 
      widespread pain and symptom severity. A latent executive function measure was 
      derived using confirmatory factor analysis. Cross-sectional associations were 
      examined using linear regression, and longitudinal structural equation modelling 
      assessed cognitive decline. Mediation analysis evaluated indirect effects of 
      abnormal sleep duration, anxiety, depression, brain fog, fatigue, and pain 
      qualities. RESULTS: We included 35 423 participants (median age 65 yr; 52% 
      female). Greater nociplastic pain severity was associated with worse executive 
      function cross-sectionally (β=-0.49 centiles per 1 point increase in fibromyalgia 
      index; 95% confidence interval -0.59 to -0.39), with a stronger effect in males. 
      However, nociplastic pain severity was not associated with a faster rate of 
      executive function decline. Abnormal sleep duration, anxiety, pain intensity, and 
      neuropathic pain features partially mediated the cross-sectional association. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Nociplastic pain severity is associated with worse executive 
      function but reassuringly does not suggest worse cognitive decline. Abnormal 
      sleep duration, anxiety, and pain intensity are highlighted as potential 
      intervention targets.
