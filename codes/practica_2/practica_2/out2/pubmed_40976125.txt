AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis is a critical stage in liver disease progression and 
      can advance to cirrhosis without appropriate treatment. Hepatitis B virus 
      infection is the primary cause of liver fibrosis. Antiviral drugs, e.g., 
      entecavir, are widely used to treat liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Additionally, 
      Chinese patent medicines, such as Biejiajian Pill (BJP), Liuwei Wuling Tablet 
      (LWT), Fufang Biejia Ruangan Tablet (FFT), Fuzheng Huayu Capsule (FZC), and Anluo 
      Huaxian Pill (AHP), demonstrate therapeutic effects. However, there is still 
      insufficient evidence-based agreement on the most effective therapies and how 
      they work. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the most effective Chinese 
      patent medicines for treating liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by combining network 
      meta-analysis and network pharmacology. It also summarises and evaluates the 
      potential mechanisms of effective treatment methods based on published clinical 
      research data. The aim is to provide scientific evidence for clinical 
      decision-making. Finally, these results were verified through experiments. The 
      aim is to provide a scientific basis for clinical decision-making. METHODS: We 
      conducted a comprehensive search of eight databases (PubMed, Web of Science, 
      Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge 
      Infrastructure (CNKI), Weipu Database (VIP), and Wanfang) for studies published 
      up to April 2025. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, clinical 
      outcomes such as Hyaluronic Acid (HA), Laminin (LN), Type IV Collagen (IV-C), 
      Type III Procollagen (PC-III), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine 
      Aminotransferase (ALT), and Total Bilirubin (TBIL) were analyzed. A 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using network 
      pharmacology, with core genes identified via CytoHubba in CytoScape 3.10.0. Gene 
      Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses 
      were used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Next, we validated these 
      predictions using in vivo experiments, observing pathological changes through HE 
      Staining, Masson's Trichrome Staining, Picro Sirius Red Staining, and 
      Immunohistochemistry, and performing protein expression analysis using Western 
      blotting. RESULTS: A total of 380 studies involving 37,380 patients, were 
      included. Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) and Rank 1 
      probability were used to assess the therapeutic efficacy of each prescription. 
      For liver fibrosis, AHP was the most effective, followed by LWT, FZC, BJP, and 
      FFT. In cirrhosis treatment, LWT was the most effective, followed by AHP, FZC, 
      BJP, and FFT. Combined with network pharmacology analyses revealed that AHP and 
      LWT might play a role in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by regulating targets such 
      as Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3), Matrix 
      Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), Protein kinase B (AKT1), etc. Animal experiments have 
      shown that Chinese patent medicines such as LWT and AHP can significantly improve 
      liver damage in mice and reduce the levels of Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA), 
      Transforming Growth Factor Beta (TGF-β), Fibronectin (FN), STAT3, and MMP9 in the 
      CCL(4) group, while increasing the expression and content of AKT1. CONCLUSION: 
      AHP and LWT are the most effective treatments for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, 
      respectively according to current network meta-analysis. LWT and AHP may play a 
      role in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis by regulating targets such as STAT3, MMP9, 
      and AKT1, providing a solid foundation for clinical treatment strategies.
