TI  - Association between lower fasting plasma glucose levels during oral glucose 
      tolerance test and adverse perinatal outcomes: A Chinese cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level within the 
      normal range as defined by the International Association of Diabetes and 
      Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria is associated with perinatal outcomes. 
      This study explored the associations between FPG levels lower than the IADPSG 
      threshold during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and adverse perinatal 
      outcomes in women with or without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: From January 1, 2017, to May 31, 2022, this single-center 
      retrospective cohort study included 33,417 women with singleton pregnancies at 
      the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. All 
      women underwent a 75-g OGTT at 24-28 gestational weeks. The primary endpoint was 
      a composite of adverse outcomes, including gestational hypertension, 
      preeclampsia, fetal death and stillbirth, preterm birth, primary cesarean 
      delivery, and small or large for gestational age. Overall, 3,108 (9.5%) women had 
      IADPSG-defined GDM and of whom 2,426 (76.3%) had FPG levels below the IADPSG 
      threshold. Compared to the GDM population, non-GDM women with borderline-normal 
      FPG levels were at significantly greater risk of adverse outcomes with an 
      adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.62 (95% CI [1.20, 2.19]; p = 0.002) at 4.6 mmol/L, 
      an aOR of 1.50 (95% CI [1.05, 2.13]; p = 0.025) at 4.8 mmol/L, and an aOR of 1.58 
      (95% CI [1.05, 2.40]; p = 0.030) at 4.9 mmol/L glucose level. Nonetheless, 
      non-GDM women demonstrated significantly lower risk (aOR 0.66, 95% CI [0.44, 
      0.98]; p = 0.038) compared to GDM counterparts exhibiting low fasting glycemia at 
      3.9 mmol/L. However, this study was limited by its retrospective design and may 
      lack generalizability to other ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Even at FPG levels 
      lower than the IADPSG threshold, FPG was significantly associated with adverse 
      perinatal outcomes, and the associations presented different patterns in women 
      with and without GDM.
