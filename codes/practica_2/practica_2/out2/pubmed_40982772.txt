      Disease: A Prospective Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intrinsic capacity (IC), a World Health 
      Organization-defined measure of healthy aging, has been linked to several 
      neurologic disorders but has not been extrapolated to Parkinson disease (PD). The 
      study aimed to explore the association between IC and incident PD and whether 
      genetic risk modulated this association. METHODS: This longitudinal analysis used 
      data from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the 
      impact of genetic and environmental factors on health outcomes. Participants were 
      voluntarily recruited from 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom 
      between 2006 and 2010. Individuals with IC component data and without 
      pre-existing PD or dementia at baseline were included. The IC deficit score was 
      derived from 4 domains: psychological (exhaustion and sleep duration), sensory 
      (visual and hearing impairments), vitality (grip strength and weight loss), and 
      locomotor function (walking speed), while the cognitive domain was not assessed. 
      Genetic risk was estimated by polygenic risk score, and incident PD was 
      identified using an algorithm. Cox proportional hazard models were used to 
      calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 401,791 
      participants (mean age [SD], 56.6 [8.0] years; 53.8% female) included, 2,763 
      (0.69%) developed PD during a median follow-up of 12.3 years. The HR (95% CI) for 
      incident PD was 1.82 (1.50-2.20) in individuals with IC deficit scores of 4+ 
      compared with those with 0. Each 1-point increment in IC deficit was associated 
      with a 16% (95% CI 12%-20%) increased risk of PD. Low IC was associated with a 
      68% (95% CI 48%-91%) higher risk of incident PD. Individuals with low IC and high 
      genetic risk were at the highest PD risk (HR = 3.01; 95% CI 2.40-3.78). High 
      genetic risk attenuated the protective role of high IC (HR [95% CI]: 0.45 
      [0.35-0.58] in low risk vs 0.72 [0.59-0.88] in high risk; P for interaction = 
      0.002), but high IC was still associated with a diminished risk of PD in the 
      high-risk group. DISCUSSION: High IC was associated with a decreased risk of PD, 
      even in genetically high-risk individuals. The absence of the cognitive domain 
      may limit understanding of the association.
