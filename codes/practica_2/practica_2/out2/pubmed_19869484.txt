TI  - THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THE FIBROBLAST AND THE MACROPHAGE : IV. THE 
      MALIGNANT FIBROBLAST OF JENSEN SARCOMA.
PG  - 285-98
AB  - 1. A pure strain of fibroblasts has been isolated from the Jensen rat sarcoma. 
      The cells give rise to tumors on transplantation into animals and during several 
      months of life in vitro have maintained their malignancy unchanged. 2. The 
      malignant cells are generally coarser and more refringent than normal cells. They 
      possess the cytological characteristics of fibroblasts without showing any 
      morphological abnormality. They can be considered as healthy cells. The texture 
      of their colonies is looser than that of normal fibroblasts and Sarcoma No. 10 
      fibroblasts. Their residual activity does not differ markedly from the normal. 
      They proliferate unlimitedly in a nutrient medium. 3. They liquefy the fibrin of 
      rat plasma and turn phenol red golden yellow. They do not liquefy the fibrin of 
      chicken plasma. 4. They multiply in chick embryo juice, calf liver digest, and 
      also in rat serum. Their growth activity is increased by the presence of bone 
      marrow. 5. The unlimited growth of Jensen sarcoma within the body may possibly be 
      attributed to the ability of the fibroblasts to maintain themselves upon the 
      substances present in rat serum. This property itself probably depends upon the 
      increased enzyme activity of the cells.
