AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive and 
      heterogeneous breast cancer subtype, remains clinically challenging due to the 
      paucity of actionable therapeutic targets. The unique metabolic landscape of 
      TNBC, characterized by elevated iron and lipid levels, renders it particularly 
      susceptible to ferroptosis, positioning this cell death modality as a promising 
      therapeutic avenue. Eriocalyxin B (Eri B), a natural diterpenoid, exhibits 
      multifaceted anticancer properties that warrant further investigation. OBJECT: To 
      elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of Eri B-induced ferroptosis in TNBC. METHOD: 
      In this study, the anti-proliferative effects of Eri B on TNBC cells were 
      evaluated using cell colony formation assays, three-dimensional tumor sphere 
      formation assays, EdU incorporation assays, and analysis of the proliferation 
      marker Ki-67. The anti-metastatic potential of Eri B was assessed through wound 
      healing assays, transwell migration assays, immunofluorescence staining, and 
      western blot analysis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), flow cytometry, 
      transmission electron microscopy, and western blotting demonstrated that Eri B 
      induces ferroptosis in TNBC cells. Molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance 
      (SPR), and cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA) provided evidence of a direct 
      interaction between Eri B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
      (STAT3). Moreover, the efficacy and underlying mechanism of Eri B were further 
      validated through SIRT3 overexpression experiments and by employing a STAT3 
      activator, colivelin. In vivo anti-TNBC activity was confirmed using a 
      xenografted tumor model combined with bioluminescence imaging. RESULT: For the 
      first time, we demonstrate that Eri B exhibits significant antitumor activity 
      both in vitro and in vivo through the induction of ferroptosis. RNA-seq analysis 
      enabled us to identify and confirm that Eri B induces ferroptosis and oxidative 
      stress by inhibiting sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), which subsequently modulates the nuclear 
      factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) 
      signaling pathway. Moreover, our findings reveal that Eri B suppresses SIRT3 
      transcription by directly targeting STAT3, thereby regulating the SIRT3-sterol 
      regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1)-peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) -mediated fatty acid metabolism and 
      cellular redox homeostasis. CONCLUSION: In summary, our findings suggest that Eri 
      B functions as a novel inducer of ferroptosis in TNBC, demonstrating potential 
      therapeutic value through the inhibition of SIRT3 in TNBC.
