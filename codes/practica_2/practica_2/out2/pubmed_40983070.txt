AB  - The treatment of type 1 diabetes is entering a transformative era. Teplizumab, 
      the first immunotherapy treatment to delay the onset of clinical type 1 diabetes, 
      has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Other immune-based 
      therapies show promise in preserving β-cell function. Public health screening 
      using islet autoantibodies is expanding, enabling earlier diagnosis, reducing 
      diabetic ketoacidosis, and allowing timely introduction of disease-modifying 
      treatments before the need for insulin therapy. β-cell replacement is shifting 
      from traditional transplantation of organ donor islets and the pancreas to stem 
      cell-derived β cells. Bioengineering methods, such as encapsulation, and gene 
      editing to create hypoimmune cells could reduce the need for immunosuppression 
      that has hampered β-cell replacement, and patient-derived stem cells open doors 
      to personalised therapies. Although these innovations have been made available to 
      a small number of patients, scaling them to widespread use remains a challenge. 
      Meanwhile, glucose regulation is improving through the use of automated insulin 
      delivery systems that combine glucose monitoring with insulin pumps. 
      New-generation insulins (those that are ultrarapid, ultralong, and 
      glucose-responsive) improve outcomes by minimising blood sugar fluctuations. 
      Together, these breakthroughs offer renewed hope for improving long-term 
      management and quality of life for people living with type 1 diabetes.
