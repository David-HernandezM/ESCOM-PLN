TI  - Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy and the risk of 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the offspring.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may result in compromised neurodevelopment 
      through inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms, through predisposition to 
      oxidative stress, and through endocrine, endogenous cannabinoid, and other 
      mechanisms. Several small and large prospective studies have found an association 
      between gestational acetaminophen exposure and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
      disorder (ADHD)-like behaviors, use of ADHD medication, and ADHD diagnoses in 
      offspring during childhood; the only negative study was a small investigation 
      that examined only one aspect of attention as an outcome. Creditably, most of the 
      studies adjusted analyses for many (but not all) confounds associated with ADHD 
      risk. Importantly, one pivotal study also adjusted for pain, infection, 
      inflammation, and fever to reduce confounding by indication; this study found a 
      dose-dependent risk. In the light of the finding of a single study that infection 
      and fever during pregnancy by themselves do not raise the ADHD risk, it appears 
      possible that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is itself responsible for 
      the increased risk of ADHD. This suggests that acetaminophen may not be as safe 
      in pregnancy as is widely believed. However, since fever during pregnancy may 
      itself be associated with adverse gestational outcomes, given the present level 
      of uncertainty about the ADHD risk with acetaminophen, it is suggested that, 
      until more data are available, the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy should not 
      be denied in situations in which the need for the drug is clear.
