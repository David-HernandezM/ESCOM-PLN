AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), a chronic disorder affecting 
      approximately 10 % of adults worldwide with heightened prevalence in males and 
      obese populations, induces irreversible neurocognitive impairment. Atraric Acid 
      (AA), a natural depside compound derived from lichens, exhibits dual functional 
      properties through its molecular groups capable of free radical scavenging and 
      metal chelation. However, its therapeutic potential in OSAS-related pathologies 
      remains unexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective 
      effects and molecular mechanisms of AA against CIH-induced neuronal damage. 
      METHODS: CIH mouse models and hypoxic injury models in HT22 neurons were 
      established. AA was administered to mice at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg 
      (selected based on literature references and preliminary experiments), and to 
      cells at an optimal concentration of 20 μM (determined by CCK-8 assays). 
      Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated through behavioral tests including the Morris 
      Water Maze, Elevated Plus Maze, and Open Field Test. Neuroprotective effects were 
      assessed via histopathological examination (e.g., neuronal survival in 
      hippocampal CA3 and DG sub-regions) and detection of oxidative stress/ferroptosis 
      markers (e.g., MDA levels, GPX4 expression, and related biomarkers). 
      Transcriptomic sequencing and molecular docking analyses were employed to 
      investigate differentially expressed genes, pathway enrichment, and underlying 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that AA 
      significantly alleviated neuronal damage in CIH mice and enhanced HT22 cell 
      viability. AA down-regulated oxidative stress- and ferroptosis-related gene 
      expression. Transcriptomic sequencing identified AMPK signaling as a key target. 
      Combined AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) and nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation 
      experiments confirmed that AA synergistically regulates dual antioxidant pathways 
      (Nrf2/HO-1 and FoxO3a/SOD2) via AMPK activation. CONCLUSION: AA mitigates 
      CIH-induced neurocognitive impairment by AMPK-dependent activation of the 
      Nrf2/HO-1 and FoxO3a/SOD2 axes, establishing a dual antioxidant-ferroptosis 
      defense barrier. This study is the first to systematically elucidate AA's 
      molecular mechanisms using transcriptomics data integrated with computational 
      simulations, providing novel therapeutic targets and a translational paradigm for 
      developing natural compound-based therapies for OSAS.
