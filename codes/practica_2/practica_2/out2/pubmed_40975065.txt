AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous condition, but its phenotypic variation 
      and links with mortality are unclear. We apply the discriminative dimensionality 
      reduction with trees (DDRTree) algorithm to seven clinical variables in 10,091 
      adults with newly diagnosed T2D from a nationally representative Chinese cohort. 
      Distinct mortality patterns are observed across phenotypes. Cardiovascular 
      mortality is highest in the most hypertensive and obese individuals, while 
      diabetic ketoacidosis/coma mortality is largely driven by the combination of 
      hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Additionally, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease mortality is higher in those with elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
      and total cholesterol levels. These patterns are similar in UK Biobank, though 
      cardiovascular mortality is highest in those with dyslipidemia and obesity. 
      Predictive models incorporating these variables show good performance and an 
      online tool is provided for individual risk prediction. Overall, this study 
      visualizes phenotypic variation in T2D and its impact on mortality, underscoring 
      the need for personalized treatment strategies.
