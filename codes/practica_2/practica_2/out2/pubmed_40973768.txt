TI  - The endogenous T cell landscape is reshaped by CAR-T cell therapy and predicts 
      treatment response in multiple myeloma.

AB  - While most patients initially respond to CAR-T cell treatment, responses often 
      are not durable and subsequent lines of immunotherapy show diminishing success. 
      In this study, we investigated the co-evolutionary dynamics between CAR-T cells 
      and the immune microenvironment in myeloma patients undergoing anti-BCMA CAR-T 
      cell therapy at single-cell resolution. Our findings highlight the transformative 
      impact of CAR-T cell treatment on the endogenous T cell landscape. We identify a 
      novel transitional CD8 + T cell population that is predictive of poor treatment 
      outcomes. The emergence of this population coincides with the depletion of the 
      endogenous T cell repertoire and compositional evolution of functional T cell 
      subsets. These changes in the endogenous T cell compartment induced by CAR-T cell 
      therapy may contribute to inadequate immune capacity and tumor control. Our 
      findings highlight the potential of targeting TIM3/GAL9 interactions to mitigate 
      T cell exhaustion, apoptosis and lack of persistence, offering promising avenues 
      for optimizing T cell-based cancer immunotherapies. We provide a framework for 
      assessing and manipulating the 'mileage' of the immune system as predictive 
      marker and therapeutic opportunity to prevent repeated immunotherapies from 
      becoming increasingly less successful, even when targeting distinct antigens.
