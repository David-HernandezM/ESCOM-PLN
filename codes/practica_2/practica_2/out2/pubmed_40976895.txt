      from the Crosstalk between Immunometabolism and Ferroptosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent evidence increasingly supports a potential role of 
      Perivascular Macrophages (PVMs), a unique subpopulation of brain immune cells, in 
      the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategically positioned at the 
      brain-vasculature interface, PVMs sense the redox status, modulate immunity, and 
      potentially influence ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death 
      increasingly implicated in AD. However, whether the involvement of PVMs in AD 
      pathology specifically entails mechanisms related to the crosstalk between 
      immunometabolism and ferroptosis, and the precise molecular pathways linking 
      PVMs, immunometabolism, and ferroptosis to AD, remains unclear. METHODS: We first 
      obtained single-cell RNA sequencing data of PVMs from AD patients and control 
      subjects via the GEO database, identified Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), 
      and applied Mendelian Randomization (MR), with robustness validated via 
      leave-one-out analysis to pinpoint key genes among the DEGs with causal relevance 
      to AD. Next, we identified ferroptosis-related genes within these key genes and 
      examined their associations with immune cell infiltration and immunometabolic 
      signaling pathways, while also predicting their regulatory transcription factors 
      to inform potential therapeutic strategies. RESULTS: We identified 149 DEGs in 
      PVMs between AD and control groups, which were primarily enriched in immune and 
      metabolic pathways. MR analysis established eight genes (ACSL1, SPATA6, RAB31, 
      NIBAN1, HDAC4, GRAMD1B, GCC2, and DENND3) as causally and negatively associated 
      with AD risk (IVW analysis identified all P < 0.05, with robustness confirmed by 
      leave-one-out analysis), with ACSL1 being recognized as a known ferroptosis 
      driver. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant differences in 
      monocyte and neutrophil proportions in AD, with DENND3 identified as the sole 
      gene significantly correlated with monocyte abundance. The Key genes demonstrated 
      distinct associations with immunometabolic pathways: GRAMD1B expression was 
      positively associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, whereas both NIBAN1 and 
      SPATA6 showed enrichment in cells with high Notch signaling activity. ACSL1 
      exhibited robust associations with multiple pathways implicated in ferroptosis, 
      including the IL-6/JAK/STAT3, interferon-γ, TGF-β, bile acid metabolism, and 
      cholesterol homeostasis pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms that mediate 
      the crosstalk between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Transcription factor 
      analysis highlighted shared regulation by CEBPD and the SP1/2/3/4 family, 
      indicating convergent transcriptional control of these genes. CONCLUSION: This 
      study identifies eight key genes in PVMs that may protect against AD through 
      mechanisms involving the interplay between immunometabolism and ferroptosis. Our 
      findings provide novel insights into the function of PVMs in AD pathophysiology 
      and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this devastating neurodegenerative 
      disease.
