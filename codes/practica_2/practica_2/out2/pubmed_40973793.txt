TI  - Cancer-associated fibroblasts drive lung adenocarcinoma progression via 
      THBS2-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

AB  - The role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the initiation and invasion 
      phases of human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) development is not fully understood. 
      In this study, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, 
      and a combination of in vivo and in vitro models to decode the dynamics of 
      tumor-stroma interactions during human LUAD progression, focusing primarily on 
      adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and 
      invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC). We identified a matrix CAF (mCAF) subtype 
      characterized by high THBS2 expression, which was closely associated with poor 
      clinical outcomes, tumor recurrence, and the invasive dynamics of LUAD. Spatial 
      transcriptomics and multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that this 
      CAF subpopulation was closely associated with tumor cells, with clear spatial 
      colocalization. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that THBS2 secreted 
      by these mCAFs directly binds to SDC4 on tumor cells, enhancing tumor 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs. This study highlights THBS2+ 
      mCAFs as key regulators of tumor-stroma interactions and identifies the 
      THBS2-SDC4-EMT axis as a potential therapeutic target in LUAD.
