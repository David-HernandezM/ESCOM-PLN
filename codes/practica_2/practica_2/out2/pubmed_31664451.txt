TI  - Association of Cord Plasma Biomarkers of In Utero Acetaminophen Exposure With 
      Risk of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder in 
      Childhood.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have raised concern about maternal acetaminophen use 
      during pregnancy and increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
      (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in their children; however, most 
      studies have relied on maternal self-report. OBJECTIVE: To examine the 
      prospective associations between cord plasma acetaminophen metabolites and 
      physician-diagnosed ADHD, ASD, both ADHD and ASD, and developmental disabilities 
      (DDs) in childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective cohort 
      study analyzed 996 mother-infant dyads, a subset of the Boston Birth Cohort, who 
      were enrolled at birth and followed up prospectively at the Boston Medical Center 
      from October 1, 1998, to June 30, 2018. EXPOSURES: Three cord acetaminophen 
      metabolites (unchanged acetaminophen, acetaminophen glucuronide, and 
      3-[N-acetyl-l-cystein-S-yl]-acetaminophen) were measured in archived cord plasma 
      samples collected at birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Physician-diagnosed ADHD, 
      ASD, and other DDs as documented in the child's medical records. RESULTS: Of 996 
      participants (mean [SD] age, 9.8 [3.9] years; 548 [55.0%] male), the final sample 
      included 257 children (25.8%) with ADHD only, 66 (6.6%) with ASD only, 42 (4.2%) 
      with both ADHD and ASD, 304 (30.5%) with other DDs, and 327 (32.8%) who were 
      neurotypical. Unchanged acetaminophen levels were detectable in all cord plasma 
      samples. Compared with being in the first tertile, being in the second and third 
      tertiles of cord acetaminophen burden was associated with higher odds of ADHD 
      diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] for second tertile, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.40-3.69; OR for 
      third tertile, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.77-4.67) and ASD diagnosis (OR for second tertile, 
      2.14; 95% CI, 0.93-5.13; OR for third tertile, 3.62; 95% CI, 1.62-8.60). 
      Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses found consistent associations between 
      acetaminophen buden and ADHD and acetaminophen burden and ASD across strata of 
      potential confounders, including maternal indication, substance use, preterm 
      birth, and child age and sex, for which point estimates for the ORs vary from 2.3 
      to 3.5 for ADHD and 1.6 to 4.1 for ASD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cord 
      biomarkers of fetal exposure to acetaminophen were associated with significantly 
      increased risk of childhood ADHD and ASD in a dose-response fashion. Our findings 
      support previous studies regarding the association between prenatal and perinatal 
      acetaminophen exposure and childhood neurodevelopmental risk and warrant 
      additional investigations.
