TI  - A Pilot Study on the Relationship between Obstructive Sleep Apnoea-Hypopnea 
      Syndrome, Neurodevelopment, and Ricketts' Cephalometry.

AB  - Background: The aim of this research is to achieve the early detection of facial 
      characteristics in patients diagnosed with neurodevelopmental deficits and 
      obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) through the analysis of the 
      VERT index and Ricketts' cephalometry to minimise the neurocognitive morbidity 
      associated with these disorders. Methods: This clinical study was conducted on 44 
      patients aged 4 to 15 years. Participants completed an initial questionnaire 
      about sleep disturbances, followed by a polysomnography, a radiographic study, 
      and an oral examination. Results: The maximum variability in the data was 
      obtained in the mandibular plane angle, where we observed that the measurement 
      was higher in patients diagnosed with OSAHS. The relative and normalised indices 
      of facial depth and the mandibular plane showed variations between patients with 
      a clinical picture compatible with OSAHS and the control group without pathology. 
      Conclusions: Our findings indicate that Ricketts' VERT index by itself is unable 
      to provide evidence of a diagnosis compatible with OSAHS in patients with early 
      neurodevelopmental deficits, but, after analysing the results obtained, we 
      observed that for the cephalometric measurements of the mandibular plane angle 
      and facial depth relative to the patient's age, there are sufficiently strong 
      variations for creating a solid method of differential diagnosis, thus preventing 
      complications at the neurocognitive level.
