AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) are important cardiovascular risk factors. However, 
      the prognostic impact of coexisting MASLD and CKD remains understudied. METHODS: 
      This study cohort used the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey) 2007 to 2018 database, examining outcomes in adults with varying MASLD 
      and CKD statuses. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes 
      included coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and cancer. Cox 
      regression model was constructed to investigate the relationship between 
      MASLD/CKD and all-cause mortality, adjusted for age, prior coronary heart 
      disease, body mass index, smoking, poverty-to-income ratio, lipid-lowering and 
      glucose-lowering medications. Sensitivity analysis was performed with hepatic 
      fibrosis and CKD. RESULTS: Among 14 818 participants (mean follow-up: 
      6.9 ± 3.4 years), a majority of participants had MASLD(-)/CKD(-) (50.8%), 
      followed by MASLD(+)/CKD(-) (34.8%), MASLD(+)/CKD(+) (7.7%), and MASLD(-)/CKD(+) 
      (6.7%). MASLD(+)/CKD(+) (n = 1142) had the highest rates of obesity (77.6%), 
      hypertension (77.5%), dyslipidemia (67.0%), and diabetes (49.7%), with the 
      highest risk of coronary heart disease (risk ratio [RR], 1.79 [95% CI, 
      1.13-2.82],P = 0.013) and heart failure (RR 2.33 [95% CI, 1.07-5.08], P = 0.033). 
      Socioeconomic disparities were observed, with lower-income individuals 
      predominantly in the group with MASLD(+)/CKD(+) (P < 0.001). MASLD(+)/CKD(+) 
      (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.28 [95% CI, 1.89-5.70], P < 0.001) and 
      MASLD(-)/CKD(+) (aHR, 2.18 [95% CI, 1.33-3.66], P = 0.002) phenotypes were 
      independent mortality predictors. Although MASLD(-)/CKD(+) and MASLD(+)/CKD(+) 
      had unfavorable 10-year prognoses, survival was worse in those with both hepatic 
      fibrosis and CKD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: MASLD(+)/CKD(+) phenotype increases 
      the risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity and independently predicts mortality. 
      Mortality risk increased progressively in individuals with both advanced hepatic 
      fibrosis and CKD.
