AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease marked by 
      cartilage degradation, inflammation, and changes in subchondral bone structure. 
      Despite its widespread use in treating OA, the mechanisms of traditional Chinese 
      medicine (TCM) are not well understood. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the 
      bioactive components and therapeutic mechanism of Yiqi Xugu HeJi (YQXGHJ), a 
      classic TCM prescription, in alleviating OA progression. METHODS: A 
      destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA rat model was established 
      to evaluate the protective effects of YQXGHJ. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass 
      Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identified serum-absorbed compounds, while network 
      pharmacology and molecular docking predicted potential targets. Cellular and 
      molecular validation, including CCK-8, EdU, flow cytometry, qPCR, Western 
      blotting, immunofluorescence, and Transwell assays, were performed in 
      IL-1β-induced chondrocyte inflammation models. Key signaling pathways were 
      verified using the AKT inhibitor MK2206. RESULTS: YQXGHJ significantly alleviated 
      cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone sclerosis in DMM rats. In vitro, 
      YQXGHJ-containing serum promoted chondrocyte proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, 
      and restored the balance between anabolic (COL2A1, SOX9) and catabolic (MMP13, 
      IL-6) markers. Network pharmacology and docking pinpointed AKT1 as a central 
      target, with KEGG analysis emphasizing the PI3K-AKT pathway. Western blot and 
      immunofluorescence confirmed that YQXGHJ activated PI3K/AKT signaling and 
      enhanced phosphorylation at the AKT1-T473 site. Inhibition of AKT1 
      phosphorylation by MK2206 abolished these protective effects, confirming pathway 
      specificity. CONCLUSION: YQXGHJ mitigates OA progression by reestablishing 
      cartilage metabolic balance through the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling 
      pathway, specifically enhancing AKT1-T473 phosphorylation. This study provides a 
      pharmacological and mechanistic foundation for the clinical use of YQXGHJ in 
      treating OA.
