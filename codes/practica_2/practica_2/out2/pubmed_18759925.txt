AB  - Establishing a balance between the rapid generation of effective immunity and the 
      production of overly exuberant or excessively prolonged responses is critical to 
      the maintenance of the equilibrium between health and disease. The preservation 
      of homeostasis and prevention of inappropriate activation of immunity is 
      safeguarded by systems integrating the influences of T-cell receptor signaling, 
      pro-inflammatory danger signals, and positive costimulatory signals on the one 
      hand with those of several layers of both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic 
      inhibitory checkpoints on the other. Evolution has thus provided an immunological 
      system capable of clearance of pathogens and infected cells but which generally 
      avoids the severe collateral damage that is associated with failure to control 
      immunity. Central tolerance to self-antigens constitutes the first line of 
      defense against self-destruction. Because central tolerance mechanisms fail to 
      eliminate all self-reactive immune effector cells, other immune-regulating 
      (peripheral tolerance) mechanisms are required to prevent excessive immune 
      responses. Dysfunction of these inhibitory pathways in terms of reduced activity 
      can result in the unmasking of self-directed responses and a variety of 
      autoimmune morbidities. Conversely, enhanced inhibitory activity can restrict the 
      generation of clinically useful immunity to cancers and to chronic infectious 
      pathogens. This may manifest not only as inhibition of immunity directed towards 
      what are largely aberrantly or overexpressed 'self' targets on malignant cells 
      but also additional exaggeration of inhibitory pathway activity mediated via 
      upregulation on tumor cells or stromal tissues of the ligands for inhibitory 
      receptors expressed by lymphocytes. The selective pressures exerted by 
      immuno-editing will favor the outgrowth of such immuno-evasive malignant clones. 
      These pathways therefore represent significant hurdles to the generation of 
      therapeutic anti-cancer responses. The most active of the T-cell intrinsic 
      inhibitory pathways belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily, which occupies a 
      central importance in the coordination of immune responses. The CD28/cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4):B7-1/B7-2 receptor/ligand grouping represents the 
      archetypal example of these immune regulators. Therapies aimed at overcoming 
      these mechanisms of peripheral tolerance, in particular by blocking the 
      inhibitory checkpoints, offer the potential to generate anti-tumor activity, 
      either as monotherapies or in synergism with other therapies that directly or 
      indirectly enhance presentation of tumor epitopes to the immune system.
