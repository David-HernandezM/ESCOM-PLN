AB  - The gut-brain axis is an emerging factor in promoting multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      However, the underlying mechanisms and strategies to target this axis are not 
      established. Here, we investigated how the gut environment influences 
      myelin-specific Th17 cell pathogenicity. We used the adoptive Th17 cell transfer 
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and antibiotic treatment to 
      disrupt the intestinal microbiome. We observed reduced pathogenic Th17 cell 
      signature in the colon of antibiotic-treated mice. Treatment with fecal filtrates 
      enhanced myelin-specific Th17 cell encephalitogenic properties both in vitro and 
      in vivo. Fecal metabolomic profiling identified altered tryptophan-derived 
      metabolites, including indole-3-carboxylate (I3CA). Oral I3CA supplementation 
      accelerated EAE development. I3CA concentration in blood samples from persons 
      with MS (PwMS) was associated with increased disease severity mirrored by 
      increased serum neurofilament light chain levels. Altogether, our study shows 
      that microbiota-derived metabolites play a key role in the intestine during 
      neuroinflammation, offering potential therapeutic insights for PwMS.
