AB  - Positive airway pressure therapy remains the gold standard treatment for 
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but challenges with adherence, acceptability, and 
      side effects persist. Interest in pharmacological therapies has grown, 
      culminating in the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of 
      tirzepatide as the first pharmacotherapy for OSA. Our review critically examines 
      the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments for OSA and highlights current 
      limitations and future research directions. We conducted a search of Medline and 
      Embase for randomized controlled trials published from January 2005 to February 
      2025, identifying 41 studies investigating 37 different drugs or drug 
      combinations. Weight-loss therapies showed the most consistent and substantial 
      improvements in OSA severity. Tirzepatide produced the largest reduction in 
      apnea-hypopnea index and improved patient-reported outcomes and cardiometabolic 
      risk factors. Other pharmacotherapies demonstrated modest and inconsistent 
      effects on OSA severity, sometimes with side-effects that contradict the 
      treatment goal to reduce daytime sleepiness. Weight-loss agents, particularly 
      tirzepatide, represent a promising and now clinically viable treatment option. 
      While endotype-targeted approaches are conceptually attractive, many agents were 
      too early in their testing/re-purposing phase to demonstrate improvements in 
      sleepiness, quality of life or sustained reductions of OSA severity; or were 
      insufficiently targeted at the endotype they might best treat.
