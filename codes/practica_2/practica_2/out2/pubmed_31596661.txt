AB  - Background: Since 2007, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) has been 
      provided free-of-charge to primary, middle school and high school students in 
      Beijing. However, there have been few school-based studies on influenza vaccine 
      effectiveness (VE). In this report, we estimated influenza VE against 
      laboratory-confirmed influenza illness among school children in Beijing, China 
      during the 2016-2017 influenza season.Methods: The VE of 2016-2017 TIV against 
      laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection among school-age children was 
      assessed through a case-control design. Conditional logistic regression was 
      conducted on matched case-control sets to estimate VE. The effect of prior 
      vaccination on current VE was also examined.Results: All 176 samples tested 
      positive for influenza A virus with the positive rate of 55.5%. The average 
      coverage rate of 2016-2017 TIV among students across the 37 schools was 30.6%. 
      The fully adjusted VE of 2016-2017 TIV against laboratory-confirmed influenza was 
      69% (95% CI: 51 to 81): 60% (95% CI: -15 to 86) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 
      73% (95% CI: 52 to 84) for influenza A(H3N2). The overall VE for receipt of 
      2015-2016 vaccination only, 2016-2017 vaccination only, and vaccinations in both 
      seasons was 46% (95% CI: -5 to 72), 77% (95% CI: 58 to 87), and 57% (95%CI: 17 to 
      78), respectively.Conclusions: Our study during school outbreaks found that VE of 
      2016-2017 TIV was moderate against influenza A(H3N2) as well as A(H1N1)pdm09 
      viruses.
