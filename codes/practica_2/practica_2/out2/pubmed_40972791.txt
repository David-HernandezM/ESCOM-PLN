AB  - BACKGROUND: Insufficient physical activity and prolonged sedentary behavior have 
      emerged as major global public health challenges. Short bouts (≤10 min) of 
      accumulated exercise (SBAE) throughout the day may be a promising strategy to 
      mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged sitting and promote physical activity, 
      ultimately promoting overall health. However, previous ambiguity in defining this 
      concept has resulted in a fragmented and inconsistent evidence base, impeding 
      practical applications, the development of guidelines, and policymaking. The 
      purpose of this study is to establish an operational definition of SBAE by 
      synthesizing systematic reviews and research trials alongside an expert 
      consensus. Additionally, it seeks to evaluate acute and long-term efficacy and 
      feasibility, providing evidence-based recommendations for practice and future 
      research directions. METHODS: A literature search was performed across PubMed and 
      Web of Science, followed by systematic screening and summarization of eligible 
      studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria encompassed 
      various modes/types of SBAE (bouts lasting ≤10 min, performed multiple times 
      daily with ≥30 min intervals); both aerobic and resistance exercise were 
      considered. Relevant systematic reviews and research trials were included. 
      Methodological quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty were assessed. 
      Expert consensus was obtained through a survey to evaluate recommendations and 
      agreement levels on findings. RESULTS: After analyzing 27 systematic reviews, 135 
      research studies, and an expert consensus involving 48 researchers from 11 
      countries, SBAE is defined as any exercise mode of activity, regardless of 
      intensity, that is accumulated in either continuous or intermittent bouts lasting 
      ≤10 min per session (including multiple intermittent sets) that are performed 
      multiple times (≥2 sessions/day) per day, with intervals of ≥30 min between bouts 
      or otherwise sufficient time for recovery. When used to interrupt prolonged 
      periods of sedentary time, SBAE mitigates the acute adverse effects of sedentary 
      behavior on more than 10 clinical biomarkers of endocrine, cardiovascular, and 
      brain health/function among adults of diverse ages and conditions. Moreover, SBAE 
      was superior for improving acute glycemic control compared to a single continuous 
      exercise session. As a long-term intervention (average of 11 weeks), SBAE can 
      improve over 20 health outcomes, including peak oxygen uptake, resting blood 
      pressure, and metabolic health. Additionally, SBAE might be more effective than 
      continuous exercise for improving longer-term glycemic control and body 
      composition. Long-term completion rates for SBAE interventions are generally high 
      (95%), with low dropout rates (12%) and high adherence rates even without 
      supervision (85%), and its safety has been preliminarily validated. CONCLUSION: 
      An operational definition of SBAE is provided along with its classification and 
      acute and long-term efficacy. Practical exercise prescription recommendations and 
      evidence-based strategies for various populations and contexts are provided. 
      Future research should focus on generating high-quality evidence for SBAE in 5 
      key areas: quantification and monitoring, population-specific responses, 
      optimization of exercise prescriptions, intervention efficacy, and practical 
      implementation. Additionally, addressing policy, environmental, and promotional 
      barriers is crucial for transitioning from expert consensus to public consensus, 
      and for facilitating the application of this strategy in real-world environments.
