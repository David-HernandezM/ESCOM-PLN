AB  - The prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease 
      (ALD) is rising. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism organised 
      a multistakeholder workshop focused on reducing the burden of ALD. Decreasing ALD 
      morbidity and mortality requires a multipronged approach, including increased 
      population-based screening for AUD, early recognition of ALD, and 
      multidisciplinary treatment. Recommended screening tools for alcohol use include 
      the alcohol use disorders identification test for consumption (AUDIT-C). In 
      patients with elevated AUDIT-C scores (AUDIT-C score of ≥3 points in women, ≥4 
      points in men), screening for fibrosis is recommended using non-invasive 
      blood-based tests, such as the Fibrosis-4 index. Sequential testing using 
      blood-based and imaging-based non-invasive liver disease assessment is preferred 
      to blood-based tests alone to increase the positive predictive value of referral 
      pathways. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment are effective 
      for reducing unhealthy alcohol use among adults who are not alcohol dependent. 
      Integrated care models that incorporate mental health treatment into general 
      medical settings are crucial for AUD and ALD. Emerging care models, such as 
      multidisciplinary ALD clinics and substance use navigators, can improve patient 
      engagement and outcomes. Markers of success include a reduction in per capita 
      alcohol consumption, declines in morbidity and mortality related to AUD and ALD, 
      and a decrease in health-care costs.
