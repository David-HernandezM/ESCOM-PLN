AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), particularly diffuse intrinsic 
      pontine gliomas (DIPGs), are aggressive pediatric brain tumors with a median 
      survival of less than 12 months. Notably, approximately 70% of these tumors 
      harbor P53 pathway alterations, including TP53 or PPM1D mutations. Identifying 
      precision therapies for this subset is crucial. This study aims to employ 
      transcriptomics-guided high-throughput drug screening to identify effective 
      treatments for DIPG/DMG with P53 pathway alterations. METHODS: Transcriptomic 
      profiling of 98 patient samples containing 31 DIPGs revealed key activated 
      pathways. Patient-derived cell lines were subjected to high-throughput screening 
      using a cell cycle-targeting drug library. Lead candidates were validated both in 
      vitro and in orthotopic xenograft models, while combination therapies were 
      assessed for their ability to overcome TP53-mutant resistance. RESULTS: 
      Transcriptomic analysis revealed activation of P53 and cell cycle pathways in 
      DIPGs. High-throughput drug screening identified SN-38, a topoisomerase I 
      inhibitor, as selectively targeting TP53 wild-type tumor cells by inducing G2 
      arrest and apoptosis. TP53 knockdown abolished SN-38's efficacy, while PPM1D 
      knockdown enhanced sensitivity, confirming a TP53-dependent mechanism. 
      Conversely, TP53-mutated cells exhibited SN-38 resistance via ATR pathway 
      activation. Combining SN-38 with the ATR inhibitor AZ20 restored apoptosis and 
      suppressed TP53-mutant tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Guided by 
      transcriptomic profiling, this study utilized high-throughput drug screening to 
      identify SN-38 as a potential therapy for TP53 wild-type DIPG/DMG, while the 
      SN-38 and AZ20 combination was effective against TP53-mutant tumors. This 
      approach provides a promising treatment strategy for this malignancy and 
      establishes a novel paradigm for drug screening in DIPG/DMG.
