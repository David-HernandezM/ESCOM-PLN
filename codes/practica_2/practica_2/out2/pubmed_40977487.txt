TI  - Variations in remnant cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease: a 
      national longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - AIM: Remnant cholesterol (RC) has been recognized as a modifiable risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the association between long-term changes 
      in RC during follow-up and incident CVD remains underexplored, with most research 
      focusing on baseline RC levels. METHODS: Data for this prospective cohort study 
      were derived from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). RC 
      levels were calculated using the Friedewald equation. Changes in RC, cumulative 
      RC, and the change in RC (ΔRC) were assessed by comparing RC levels at Waves 1 
      and 3. Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounders, were 
      used to evaluate the impact of baseline and dynamic RC levels on incident CVD 
      risk. RESULTS: Among 3,866 participants (46.23% male, mean age: 57.50 years) 
      followed for 5.0 years, participants with initially high RC who decreased to low 
      levels showed reduced CVD risk (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94). Those with low 
      baseline RC escalating to high levels showed similar risk (HR 0.85, 95% CI 
      0.68-1.06) compared to consistently high RC levels. Highest tertile cumulative RC 
      significantly increased CVD risk (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.11-1.69). Among high baseline 
      RC participants, those in the lowest ΔRC tertile had reduced CVD risk (HR 0.68, 
      95% CI 0.52-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal RC increases were associated with 
      higher CVD risks, while RC reductions were associated with decreased risks. RC 
      monitoring and management may contribute to CVD risk assessment and prevention, 
      though further research with direct RC measurement and clinically validated 
      outcomes is needed.

OAB - This study shows that remnant cholesterol (RC) is a modifiable risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), highlighting the importance of tracking RC level 
      and the necessity of early effective intervention in individuals with high RC 
      level, thereby reducing risks of CVD. The study found the significant 
      associations between the changes in RC and the risk of incident CVD. The 
      progression of RC level increased the risk of CVD, while the remission of RC 
      reduced the risk of CVD. Cumulative exposure to high RC levels was significantly 
      associated with increased CVD risks. Decreases in RC level in participants with 
      high baseline RC was correlated with reduced incidence of CVD. Keeping or 
      returning to a normal BMI and high cumulative physical activity were associated 
      with a higher likelihood of RC reduction, which highlights the potential 
      modifiable approaches for controlling RC.
