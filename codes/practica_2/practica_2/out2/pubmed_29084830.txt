TI  - Prenatal Exposure to Acetaminophen and Risk of ADHD.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between maternal use of acetaminophen 
      during pregnancy and of paternal use before pregnancy with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring while adjusting for 
      familial risk for ADHD and indications of acetaminophen use. METHODS: Diagnoses 
      were obtained from the Norwegian Patient Registry for 112 973 offspring from the 
      Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, including 2246 with ADHD. We estimated 
      hazard ratios (HRs) for an ADHD diagnosis by using Cox proportional hazard 
      models. RESULTS: After adjusting for maternal use of acetaminophen before 
      pregnancy, familial risk for ADHD, and indications of acetaminophen use, we 
      observed a modest association between any prenatal maternal use of acetaminophen 
      in 1 (HR = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.19), 2 (HR = 1.22; 95% CI 
      1.07-1.38), and 3 trimesters (HR = 1.27; 95% CI 0.99-1.63). The HR for more than 
      29 days of maternal acetaminophen use was 2.20 (95% CI 1.50-3.24). Use for <8 
      days was negatively associated with ADHD (HR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.81-1.00). 
      Acetaminophen use for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days was associated with 
      ADHD (HR = 6.15; 95% CI 1.71-22.05). Paternal and maternal use of acetaminophen 
      were similarly associated with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term maternal use of 
      acetaminophen during pregnancy was negatively associated with ADHD in offspring. 
      Long-term maternal use of acetaminophen during pregnancy was substantially 
      associated with ADHD even after adjusting for indications of use, familial risk 
      of ADHD, and other potential confounders.
