TI  - Male specific conserved LncRNA TSCL1 regulated target mRNA translation by 
      interaction with PIWIL1.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in diverse mammalian 
      physiological processes, yet their functions in spermatogenesis remain largely 
      underexplored. Here, we identify a unique class of conserved haploid 
      spermatid-associated lncRNAs (cHS-LncRNAs) defined by sequence conservation, 
      testis-restricted expression, and elevated levels in haploid spermatids. Among 
      these, testis-specific conserved lncRNA 1 (Tscl1) is the most highly expressed in 
      round spermatids. Tscl1-null male mice exhibit reduced sperm motility, 
      disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, abnormal fatty acid metabolism, and complete 
      infertility. Mechanistically, Tscl1 directly binds PIWIL1 and HuR via its 5' 
      stem-loop and multiple AU-rich elements, respectively. This interaction promotes 
      assembly of a PIWIL1/eIF3f/HuR/eIF4G3 complex that enhances translation of 
      fatty-acid-metabolism-related mRNAs within the chromatoid body. Notably, TSCL1 
      variants disrupting the PIWIL1-binding region are significantly enriched in 
      patients with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) compared to fertile controls. 
      Collectively, our findings uncover a critical role for Tscl1 in modulating 
      translation during spermiogenesis and implicate TSCL1 as a potential pathogenic 
      locus in human male infertility.
