      Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The protein-metabolite interactions play a pivotal role in the 
      pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the causal significance of 
      these interactions in AD pathogenesis remains elusive. METHODS: We integrated 
      datasets of protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), metabolite quantitative trait 
      loci (mQTL), and genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD. Initially, we 
      performed MR analysis to identify proteins and metabolites causally associated 
      with AD risk. To guarantee the robustness of these findings, Bayesian 
      colocalization analysis was employed to confirm shared genetic signals. 
      Meanwhile, Steiger filtering was utilized to verify the directionality of causal 
      effects. Sensitivity analyses were further carried out to assess potential 
      pleiotropy and bias. Moreover, we employed MR analysis to assess the causal 
      relationships between proteins and metabolites, identifying protein-metabolite 
      pairs that are associated with AD. Finally, we evaluated the druggability of 
      these causal proteins as potential therapeutic targets. RESULTS: Proteomic and 
      metabolomic MR analyses identified 14 proteins and 50 metabolites causally 
      associated with AD. Among these, five proteins (BIN1, C1R, SHPS1, LILRB1, and 
      TMEM106B) passed Bayesian colocalization analysis (PPH4 ≥ 80%). Notably, LILRB1 
      exhibited a protective effect against AD, while BIN1, C1R, SHPS1, and TMEM106B 
      were implicated as risk factors for the disease. Of the 50 metabolites, 38 passed 
      sensitivity and Steiger filtering analyses and were utilized for further 
      protein-metabolite pair analysis. Subsequent MR analysis revealed 13 
      protein-metabolite pairs associated with AD, involving four proteins (BIN1, C1R, 
      SHPS1, and LILRB1) and 12 metabolites. Notably, drugs targeting BIN1, including 
      M344, L-type calcium channel blockers, and BIN1 monoclonal antibodies, have been 
      reported as potential treatments for AD. For the remaining three drug targets, 
      medications used for other diseases were identified as potentially applicable. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight four proteins as potential drug targets for 
      AD, and suggest their corresponding protein-metabolite pairs should be 
      prioritized for analysis of potential mechanistic pathways.
