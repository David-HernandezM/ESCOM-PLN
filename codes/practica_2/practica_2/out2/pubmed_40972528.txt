AB  - Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are dimeric class C G protein-coupled 
      receptors, which play crucial roles in brain physiology and pathology. Among 
      them, mGlu8 is the least characterized, though it is physiologically important. 
      While recognized to signal via G(i/o) proteins, the involvement of β-arrestin is 
      unknown. Here, we found that both mGlu8 agonists and positive allosteric 
      modulators (PAMs) activate G(i) signaling, but mainly agonists induce β-arrestin 
      recruitment. We solved five human mGlu8 cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 
      structures in various states: apo, antagonist-bound, agonist + PAM-bound, agonist 
      + PAM-bound with G(i) protein, and agonist-bound with β-arrestin1 states. They 
      revealed a unique PAM-binding pocket at the extracellular side of the TM6/TM7 
      interface. Agonist and PAM promote active mGlu8 association with one G(i) protein 
      asymmetrically (2:1), while two β-arrestin1 can interact symmetrically (2:2) to 
      both subunits of an inactive dimer state to promote constitutive internalization. 
      These findings elucidate how mGlu8 selectively engages transducers, offering 
      insights into its signaling capabilities and selective drug development.
