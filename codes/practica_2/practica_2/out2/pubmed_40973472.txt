TI  - International consensus on the use of intestinal ultrasound in inflammatory bowel 
      disease trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) is increasingly used to monitor 
      treatment efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) trials. However, 
      standardized definitions for response, remission, and optimal assessment timing 
      remain undefined.An international expert consensus meeting was held to establish 
      IUS endpoints for clinical trials. METHODS : A panel of 35 international 
      gastroenterologists and radiologists participated in a modified Delphi process, 
      reviewing the literature and developing consensus statements. Agreement was 
      defined as at least 75% consensus. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 150 
      statements across four domains: general IBD (30 statements), luminal Crohn's 
      disease (CD) (43), perianal CD (51), and ulcerative colitis (UC) (26). For 
      luminal CD and UC, ultrasound response was defined by: (1) a ≥ 25% reduction in 
      bowel wall thickness (BWT) from baseline, or (2) multifactorial improvement, 
      combining BWT reduction with ≥1 grade decrease in colour Doppler signal (CDS) or 
      another IUS parameter. Assessments were set at weeks 4-8 for the colon and week 
      12 for the terminal ileum. Ultrasound remission in luminal CD was defined as: (1) 
      BWT normalization (≤3 mm), or (2) normalization of multiple parameters, including 
      BWT, CDS and all other IUS parameters. Similar remission criteria were proposed 
      for UC, but the sigmoid BWT normal range (3-4 mm) remained uncertain. The bowel 
      ultrasound score (BUSS) for CD and the Milan ultrasound criteria (MUC) for UC 
      were supported as standardized scoring system for trials. CONCLUSION: This 
      consensus provides standardized IUS definitions to enhance consistency in IBD 
      trials, supporting the integration of IUS in future research.
