AB  - Innate immune sensing through cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of 
      interferon genes (STING) surveils cytosolic DNA from invading pathogens or 
      damaged organelles and initiates a spectrum of immune responses. It is well 
      established that upon 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) binding, STING exits the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER), traverses the Golgi to trigger interferon programs, 
      and finally reaches lysosomes for signal resolution through degradation, 
      revealing a tightly choreographed itinerary for cytokine-driven immunity. 
      However, emerging studies reveal additional layers of spatiotemporal complexity: 
      ER-resident STING tunes in messenger RNA translation and Ca(2+) efflux, 
      Golgi-localized STING functions as a proton channel that initiates H(+)-dependent 
      autophagy and transcription factor EB-directed programs for organelle 
      homeostasis, and various mechanisms for metabolic remodeling and cell fate 
      determination. This review synthesizes emerging organelle-specific mechanisms of 
      cGAS-STING, delineates their roles in physiology and disease, and discusses how 
      an organelle-centric perspective may inform selective, context-sensitive 
      immunotherapies.
