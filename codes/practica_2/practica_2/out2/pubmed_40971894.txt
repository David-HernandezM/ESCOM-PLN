      neuronal and astrocytic lipotoxicity.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, muscle atrophy, and 
      systemic energy imbalance. Increasing evidence suggests a metabolic shift in ALS 
      from glucose metabolism toward fatty acid utilization; however, the downstream 
      consequences of this reprogramming on disease progression and neuropathology 
      remain poorly defined. We investigated neurometabolic changes in ALS using in 
      vitro and in vivo models of familial ALS expressing the human fused in sarcoma 
      variant R521G (hFUSR521G), along with post-mortem spinal cord tissue from ALS-FUS 
      cases. A combination of unbiased quantitative metabolomic profiling, 
      immunolabeling, and biochemical and molecular approaches were employed. Mass 
      spectrometry of cortical tissue from hFUSR521G mice and littermates revealed a 
      significant increase in acylcarnitine moieties, key substrates used in 
      mitochondrial β-oxidation and cellular energy production. Complementary 
      cytohistological analyses in hFUSR521G mice demonstrated increased lipid droplets 
      (LDs) and peroxidized lipids in both neurons and astrocytes, consistent with our 
      post-mortem findings in spinal cords of individuals carrying FUS R495X or K510E 
      mutations. Arimoclomol, previously shown to ameliorate behavioral phenotypes in 
      this ALS mouse model, was found to enhance lipid metabolism and reduce 
      lipotoxicity in hFUSR521G mice and in cultured neurons and astrocytes expressing 
      FUS R521G. Mechanistically, arimoclomol enhanced LD-mitochondrial contacts and 
      stimulated mitochondrial β-oxidation-dependent lipid catabolism under both basal 
      and pro-inflammatory conditions. This effect was abrogated by etomoxir, an 
      irreversible inhibitor of CPT1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the carnitine 
      shuttle, highlighting a CPT1-dependent mechanism for lipid mobilization. 
      Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for mitochondrial 
      lipid metabolism in ALS pathogenesis and identify a therapeutic pathway for 
      mitigating the cytotoxic consequences of lipid and acylcarnitine accumulation in 
      FUS-associated ALS.
