TI  - Is there an increased lability in parents' smoking behaviour after a childbirth?
PG  - 86-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test our hypothesis that there is an increased lability in parents' 
      smoking behaviour after a childbirth, and to search for demographic factors 
      associated with lability in parents' smoking behaviour. DESIGN: A one month, 
      prospective questionnaire study. SETTING: Maternal and child health centres in 
      Oslo, Norway. SAMPLE: 222 families in which at least one adult was smoking were 
      enrolled in the study. 37 families dropped out (16.7%) and 185 families completed 
      both questionnaires. MEASUREMENTS: Changes in daily smoking, smoking quantity, 
      and practical measures to prevent passive smoking by the children, as assessed by 
      parental reports. RESULTS: Families with a child aged less than one year (infant) 
      were more likely to make one or another positive change (quit, reduce, stop 
      smoking indoors, stop smoking in living rooms) than families with only older 
      children. There was a trend for families with an infant to make negative changes 
      more often (start smoking, increase) as well. Older parents made positive changes 
      more often than younger ones. Single parents were less likely to make positive 
      changes. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that there is an increased lability in 
      parents' smoking behaviour after a childbirth.
