AB  - Immunotherapy has transformed the treatment of cancer, yet many patients do not 
      have response or lasting benefit. Strategies to overcome resistance remain of 
      crucial importance. Oncolytic viruses offer a promising approach, with the unique 
      ability to selectively replicate within (and to destroy) cancer cells, remodel 
      the immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment, and stimulate antitumour immunity. 
      Interest in the potential of oncolytic viruses has grown steadily over the past 
      two decades, fuelled by advances in cancer immunology and viral engineering. 
      However, clinical translation has not kept pace, and although a plethora of 
      promising new constructs have entered clinical testing, several barriers continue 
      to restrict widespread clinical implementation. This Therapeutics paper 
      highlights key milestones in oncolytic virus clinical development, discusses the 
      challenges that remain, and, through clinical reflection, considers how future 
      research might be streamlined to achieve meaningful benefit for patients.
