AB  - BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen is the only analgesic considered safe for use 
      throughout pregnancy. Recent studies suggest that use during pregnancy may be 
      associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, but few have 
      examined language development. METHODS: The Illinois Kids Development Study is a 
      prospective birth cohort in east-central Illinois. Between December 2013 and 
      March 2020, 532 newborns were enrolled and had exposure data available. 
      Participants reported the number of times they took acetaminophen six times 
      across pregnancy. Language data were collected at 26.5-28.5 months using the 
      MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI; n = 298), and 36-38 
      months using the Speech and Language Assessment Scale (SLAS; n = 254). RESULTS: 
      Taking more acetaminophen during the second or third trimester was associated 
      with marginally smaller vocabularies and shorter utterance length (M3L) at 
      26.5-28.5 months. More acetaminophen use during the third trimester was also 
      associated with increased odds of M3L scores ≤25th percentile in male children. 
      More use during the second or third trimester was associated with lower SLAS 
      scores at 36-38 months. Third trimester use was specifically related to lower 
      SLAS scores in male children. CONCLUSIONS: Higher prenatal acetaminophen use 
      during pregnancy may be associated with poorer early language development. 
      IMPACT: Taking more acetaminophen during pregnancy, particularly during the 
      second and third trimesters, was associated with poorer scores on measures of 
      language development when children were 26.5-28.5 and 36-38 months of age. Only 
      male children had lower scores in analyses stratified by child sex. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first study that has used a standardized measure of 
      language development to assess the potential impact of prenatal exposure to 
      acetaminophen on language development. This study adds to the growing body of 
      literature suggesting that the potential impact of acetaminophen use during 
      pregnancy on fetal neurodevelopment should be carefully evaluated.
