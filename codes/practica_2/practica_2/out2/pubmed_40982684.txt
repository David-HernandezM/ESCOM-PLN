      immunotherapy in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.

AB  - The five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer patients remains below 50%, 
      underscoring the need for innovative therapies. One promising approach involves 
      engineering T cells to specifically target proteins uniquely overexpressed in 
      tumors, thereby controlling tumor growth without toxicity to healthy tissues. 
      Mesothelin (MSLN) contributes to the malignant and invasive phenotype in ovarian 
      cancer and has limited expression in healthy cells, making it a candidate 
      immunotherapy target. Our previous results in a mouse model of ovarian cancer 
      demonstrated that T cells engineered to express a T cell receptor (TCR) targeting 
      MSLN (TCR(MSLN)) mediated therapeutic activity, delaying tumor growth and 
      prolonging mouse survival. However, inhibitory ligands expressed in the tumor 
      microenvironment (TME) interacted with inhibitory receptors on activated T cells, 
      suppressing antitumor function. We hypothesized combining engineered T cells with 
      checkpoint blockade would enhance T cell function and improve therapeutic 
      efficacy, but administration of monospecific antibodies targeting individual 
      inhibitory pathways had no significant impact on T cell efficacy. By contrast, 
      the combination of PD-1, Tim-3, and Lag-3 blockade with engineered T cells 
      significantly improved T cell function and overall animal survival relative to 
      treatment with antibody alone or TCR(MSLN) with singlet or doublet antibody 
      combinations. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed TCR(MSLN) T cells treated with 
      the triplet antibody combination increased expression of genes involved in 
      interferon responses and metabolic function, and reduced expression of genes 
      associated with exhaustion. These results suggest that strategies to disrupt 
      multiple inhibitory pathways simultaneously may be necessary for improved 
      adoptive T cell therapy efficacy in patients.
