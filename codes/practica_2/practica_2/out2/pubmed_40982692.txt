      inhibition reactivates immune surveillance in cold tumors.

AB  - Immunotherapy modalities have revolutionized cancer treatment for a number of 
      metastatic and treatment-refractory tumor types. Still, many malignancies that 
      lack T cell infiltration and are termed immunologically "cold" fail to respond to 
      these modalities. One approach to increase tumor immunogenicity has been to 
      induce stimulator of interferon gene (STING) and downstream interferon signaling 
      that is often dysregulated in cold tumors. Despite some early success of STING 
      agonists in preclinical cancer models, these approaches have not been successful 
      in the clinic due to poor tumor penetrance and systemic toxicities. Here, we 
      performed a genome-wide CRISPR screen to uncover therapeutic targets to activate 
      STING expression in human tumors. We identified the lysosomal hydrolase Palmitoyl 
      Protein Thioesterase1 (PPT1) as a negative regulator of STING highly expressed in 
      cold ovarian and prostate tumors. Genetic or pharmacological PPT1 suppression 
      increased STING protein stability and its downstream activation of interferon and 
      inflammatory cytokine signaling to enhance T cell migration. Treatment of 
      preclinical prostate and ovarian cancer models expressing low levels of STING 
      with the small molecule PPT1 inhibitor GNS561 enhanced STING expression and 
      activation, leading to infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells that 
      turned these tumors "hot" and reduced tumor growth, fibrosis, and dissemination 
      without toxicity. Further analysis demonstrated that PPT1 is associated with 
      reduced STING expression, CD8(+) T cell numbers, overall survival, and 
      immunotherapy outcomes in ovarian and prostate cancer patients. Thus, PPT1 
      inhibition may be a promising approach to activate STING and potentiate the 
      effects of immunotherapy in cold tumors.
