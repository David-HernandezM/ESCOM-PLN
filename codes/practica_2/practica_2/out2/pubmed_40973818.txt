AB  - A systematic characterization of metabolic profiles in human health and disease 
      enhances precision medicine. Here we present a comprehensive human 
      metabolome-phenome atlas, using data from 274,241 UK Biobank participants with 
      nuclear magnetic resonance metabolic measures. This atlas links 313 plasma 
      metabolites to 1,386 diseases and 3,142 traits, with participants being 
      prospectively followed for a median of 14.9 years. This atlas uncovered 52,836 
      metabolite-disease and 73,639 metabolite-trait associations, where the ratio of 
      cholesterol to total lipids in large low-density lipoprotein percentage was found 
      as the metabolite associated with the highest number (n = 526) of diseases. In 
      addition, we found that more than half (57.5%) of metabolites showed statistical 
      variations from healthy individuals over a decade before disease onset. Combined 
      with demographics, the machine-learning-based metabolic risk score signified the 
      top 30 (around 10%) metabolites as biomarkers, yielding favourable classification 
      performance (area under the curve > 0.8) for 94 prevalent and 81 incident 
      diseases. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses provided support for causal 
      relationships of 454 metabolite-disease pairs, among which 402 exhibited shared 
      genetic determinants. Additional insights can be gleaned via an accessible 
      interactive resource ( https://metabolome-phenome-atlas.com/ ).
