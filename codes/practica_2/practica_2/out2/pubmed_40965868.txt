AB  - IMPORTANCE: The oral microbiota may be involved in the development of pancreatic 
      cancer, yet current evidence is largely limited to bacterial 16S amplicon 
      sequencing and small retrospective case-control studies. OBJECTIVE: To test 
      whether the oral bacterial and fungal microbiome is associated with the 
      subsequent development of pancreatic cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      This cohort study used data from 2 epidemiological cohorts: the American Cancer 
      Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort and the Prostate, Lung, 
      Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Among cohort participants who 
      provided oral samples, those who prospectively developed pancreatic cancer were 
      identified during follow-up. Control participants who remained free of cancer 
      were selected by 1:1 frequency matching on cohort, 5-year age band, sex, race and 
      ethnicity, and time since oral sample collection. Data were collected from August 
      2023 to September 2024, and data were analyzed from August 2023 to January 2025. 
      EXPOSURES: The oral bacterial and fungal microbiome were characterized via 
      whole-genome shotgun sequencing and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, 
      respectively. The association of periodontal pathogens of the red complex 
      (Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia) and 
      orange complex (Fusobacterium nucleatum, F periodonticum, Prevotella intermedia, 
      P nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter shower, and C 
      gracilis) with pancreatic cancer was tested via logistic regression. The 
      association of the microbiome-wide bacterial and fungal taxa with pancreatic 
      cancer was assessed by Analysis of Compositions of Microbiomes With Bias 
      Correction 2 (ANCOM-BC2). Microbial risk scores (MRS) for pancreatic cancer were 
      calculated from the risk-associated bacterial and fungal species. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: Pancreatic cancer incidence. RESULTS: Of 122â€¯000 cohort 
      participants who provided samples, 445 developed pancreatic cancer over a median 
      (IQR) follow-up of 8.8 (4.9-13.4) years and were matched with 445 controls. Of 
      these 890 participants, 474 (53.3%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 67.2 
      (7.5) years. Three oral bacterial periodontal pathogens-P gingivalis, E nodatum, 
      and P micra-were associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. A 
      bacteriome-wide scan revealed 8 oral bacteria associated with decreased and 13 
      oral bacteria associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer (false 
      discovery rate-adjusted Q statistic less than .05). Of the fungi, genus Candida 
      was associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The MRS, based on 27 
      oral species, was associated with an increase in pancreatic cancer risk 
      (multivariate odds ratio per 1-SD increase in MRS, 3.44; 95% CI, 2.63-4.51). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, oral bacteria and fungi were 
      significant risk factors for pancreatic cancer development. Oral microbiota hold 
      promise as biomarkers to identify individuals at high risk of pancreatic cancer, 
      potentially contributing to personalized prevention.
