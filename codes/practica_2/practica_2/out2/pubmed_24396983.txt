TI  - HPV related diseases in males: a heavy vaccine-preventable burden.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has a significant impact in male's health, as cause of 
      clinical manifestations ranging from genital warts to several cancers of the 
      anogenital and aero-digestive tract. HPV types which most frequently affect men 
      are 6, 11, 16 and 18, included in the HPV quadrivalent vaccine, recently approved 
      for use in males by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines 
      Agency (EMA). Although several data about the safety and efficacy of quadrivalent 
      vaccine are available, the implementation of proper immunization plans dedicate 
      to male's population cannot ignore the knowledge of the characteristics of the 
      disease in men, which in some aspects should be clarify, in particular clearance 
      of type-specific HPV infections and transmission dynamics. Purpose of this review 
      is to summarise the main information about the burden and the natural history of 
      the HPV related disease in males.
