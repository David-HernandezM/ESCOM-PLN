TI  - Association between periodontal disease and intrinsic capacity in older adults: 
      insights from NHANES 2009-2014.

AB  - Periodontal disease (PD) is a chronic inflammatory condition linked to systemic 
      health issues, yet its relationship with intrinsic capacity (IC)-a key 
      determinant of healthy aging-remained underexplored. The present study 
      investigated the associations between moderate/severe PD and IC domains in older 
      adults in a cross-sectional analysis from the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2014. From the 30,468 NHANES subjects, we 
      included participants aged ≥ 60 years with available PD and IC data. IC was 
      assessed across five domains: locomotion, cognition, psychological well-being 
      (depressive symptoms/anhedonia), sensory function (vision/hearing), and vitality 
      (nutrition/weight loss). PD was classified as moderate or severe using CDC/AAP 
      criteria. After applying exclusion criteria, 551 participants were included in 
      the analyses. The prevalence of PD was 68.97% (moderate PD:51.91%/severe 
      PD:15.06%). Severe PD was associated with reduced locomotion [odds 
      ratio(OR):2.30, 95% confidence interval(CI):1.27-4.16), impaired psychological 
      well-being (depressive symptoms) (OR:1.79, 95%CI:1.01-3.16), and sensory function 
      (vision) (OR:2.37, 95%CI:1.24-4.56), while moderate PD was linked to reduced 
      locomotion (OR:1.66, 95%CI:1.06-2.66) and impaired sensory function (hearing) 
      (OR:1.93, 95%CI:1.04-3.75). Higher mean clinical attachment loss and probing 
      pocket depth (PPD) were associated with reduced locomotion (OR:1.15, 
      95%CI:1.00-1.31 and OR:1.35, 95%CI:1.05-1.73, respectively). Mediation analysis 
      indicated that multimorbidity had minimal influence on these associations, except 
      for stroke, accounting for 13.3% of the relationship between mean PPD and 
      locomotion. The present findings highlighted the potential role of periodontal 
      health in maintaining overall functional capacity in older adults, underscoring 
      the need for integrated oral and systemic health strategies in aging populations.
