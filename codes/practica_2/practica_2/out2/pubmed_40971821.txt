      resistance by promoting PDGFB transcription in glioblastoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Temozolomide (TMZ) resistance remains the major obstacle in the 
      treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We previously found that the super-enhancer (SE) 
      complex is involved in the regulation of genes related to tumor biology, but its 
      mechanisms in mediating TMZ resistance in GBM remain poorly characterized. 
      METHODS: Comprehensive in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were conducted 
      using patient-derived cells (PDCs), patient-derived organoids, and PDCs xenograft 
      models. Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, 
      co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, protein fragment complementation 
      assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay, fluorescence polarization assay, and 
      surface plasmon resonance assay were employed to unravel the molecular 
      mechanisms. RESULTS: We found that SOX2 is significantly upregulated in 
      TMZ-resistant PDCs and associated with the poor prognosis of recurrent GBM 
      patients. Moreover, inhibition of SOX2 enhanced TMZ-induced apoptosis and DNA 
      damage response, thereby promoting TMZ chemosensitivity. Mechanically, we 
      identified PDGFB as a novel SE-associated oncogene mediated by SOX2. SE complex 
      SOX2 and HDAC1 were recruited together to the SE region of PDGFB, synergistically 
      triggering the PDGFB-MAPK/PI3K signaling axis and ultimately promoting TMZ 
      resistance. Notably, virtual screening targeting the critical interaction domain 
      between SOX2 and HDAC1 identified the FDA-approved drug fluvastatin as a potent 
      SOX2 inhibitor that effectively sensitizes GBM cells to TMZ. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Targeting the SE complex enhances TMZ chemosensitivity in GBM, providing a 
      promising therapeutic avenue to overcome drug resistance and improve clinical 
      outcomes.
