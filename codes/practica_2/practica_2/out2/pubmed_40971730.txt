TI  - Skullcapflavone II Inhibits SLC1A4-Mediated L-Serine Uptake and Promotes 
      Mitochondrial Damage in Gastric Cancer.

AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most lethal human malignancies worldwide. 
      Serine metabolism is essential for meeting biosynthetic demands and regulating 
      the redox state of GC cells. This study demonstrates that Skullcapflavone II 
      (SkII) selectively inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells. 
      Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that SkII treatment significantly 
      affects serine metabolism in GC cells, and isotope tracing experiments confirmed 
      that SkII reduces intracellular L-serine levels by inhibiting uptake rather than 
      de novo synthesis. Furthermore, IHC analysis reveal significant upregulation of 
      the L-serine transporter SLC1A4 in GC tissues. Binding studies using PELSA, SPR, 
      DARTS, CETSA, and MD suggest that SLC1A4 is a potential direct target of SkII. 
      SkII-induced disruption of serine metabolism resulted in an imbalance in 
      GSSG/GSH, leading to increased accumulation of intracellular ROS and oxidative 
      stress. This metabolic disruption causes mitochondrial damage, impaired energy 
      production, and increased apoptosis in GC cells. Additionally, in vivo studies 
      reveal that a serine and glycine deficient diet significantly enhanced the 
      antitumor efficacy of SkII, highlighting its potential as a combinatorial 
      therapeutic strategy. These findings provide compelling evidence that SkII is a 
      novel candidate for targeting serine metabolism, suggesting a promising 
      therapeutic approach for treating GC.
