AB  - Neurodegenerative and neuroimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis (ALS) share a common pathologic hallmark i.e. loss of neurons in the 
      central nervous system (CNS), despite diverse pathological manifestations. These 
      diseases present major challenges to global health due to incurable or extremely 
      difficult to treat, imposing a heavy burden on society and families. Stem cell 
      therapy, as a novel promising approach for treating various neurological 
      diseases, harnesses the regenerative potential of stem cells to repair damaged 
      neural tissues and circuits, and has become the only hope for patients to recover 
      their health or delay the deterioration of disease symptoms. In recent years, 
      researchers have successfully generated neurons from multiple types of stem 
      cells, and good curative effects have been achieved in their animal models and in 
      clinical trials. This comprehensive review elaborates on the relevant content of 
      stem cell biology, focuses on conducting an in-depth analysis of the current 
      application status of various stem cells in major neurodegenerative and 
      neuroimmune diseases including MS, AD, PD and ALS, kindling the hope for the 
      development of stem cell-based cell therapies in neurological diseases.
