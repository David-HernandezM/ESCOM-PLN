AB  - Neuroinflammation is a key pathological mechanism underlying neurodegenerative 
      diseases, and intricately interacts with protein glycosylation. Emerging evidence 
      suggests that aberrant glycosylation disrupts immune homeostasis, activates 
      microglia, and promotes the release of inflammatory mediators, thereby 
      exacerbating neuroinflammatory responses. In addition, the inflammatory 
      microenvironment can further dysregulate glycosylation patterns, creating a 
      vicious cycle that amplifies disease pathology. Although the regulatory role of 
      glycosylation in neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative diseases has 
      been recognized, the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms remain 
      incompletely understood. This review systematically examines the complex 
      crosstalk between glycosylation and neuroinflammation, with a particular focus on 
      the critical roles of glycosylation in key neurodegenerative diseases, including 
      Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis. We explore how glycosylation abnormalities contribute to 
      disease pathogenesis through effects on immune recognition, protein aggregation, 
      and cellular functions. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of these 
      diseases may pave the way for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting 
      glycosylation pathways, ultimately improving clinical outcomes for patients.
