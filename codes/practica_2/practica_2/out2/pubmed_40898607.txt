TI  - Maternal Acetaminophen Use and Offspring's Neurodevelopmental Outcome: A 
      Nationwide Birth Cohort Study.
LID - 10.1111/ppe.70071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is common globally. 
      However, its potential risks for neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, 
      including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum 
      disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID), remain uncertain in Asian 
      populations. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association between maternal 
      acetaminophen use during pregnancy and diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders 
      in offspring. METHODS: This nationwide birth cohort study included 217,602 
      children contributing 966,546 person-years using a nationwide administrative 
      database from 2005 to 2022. We investigated the association between maternal 
      acetaminophen use during pregnancy and offspring's neurodevelopmental outcomes 
      using Cox proportional hazards models, with primary analyses based on 1:1 
      propensity score (PS) matching. The robustness of the primary findings was 
      evaluated through alternative statistical approaches (adjusted model and inverse 
      probability of treatment weighting [IPTW]), sibling comparison, probabilistic 
      bias analyses for exposure misclassification, and negative exposure control 
      methods. RESULTS: Of the 217,602 children, 85,853 (39.5%) were exposed to 
      acetaminophen during pregnancy. PS-matched analyses (N = 42,123 children per 
      comparator) yielded hazard ratios of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.16) for composite 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.36) for ADHD, 1.06 (95% CI: 
      0.98, 1.15) for ASD, and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.19) for ID. Similar findings were 
      observed in adjusted models and IPTW methods. Sibling comparisons (n = 23,593) 
      showed point estimates in the opposite direction (e.g., HR of ADHD, 0.86; 95% CI, 
      0.52, 1.44). Probabilistic bias analysis for exposure misclassification suggested 
      overestimation due to unrecorded over-the-counter acetaminophen use, with effect 
      estimates shifting towards the null as misclassification increased. Negative 
      exposure controls (e.g., NSAIDs and acetaminophen use after pregnancy) indicated 
      potential positive bias in the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      PS-matched analyses indicated small increases in risk, sensitivity analyses 
      suggested that unmeasured confounding, misclassification and other biases may 
      partially explain these associations.
