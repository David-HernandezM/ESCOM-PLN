AB  - A genetic defect causing autism and epilepsy involving the contactin associated 
      protein-like 2 gene (CNTNAP2) has been discovered in a selected cohort of Amish 
      children. These children were found to have focal seizures and autistic 
      regression. Surgical biopsy of the anterior temporal lobe of two such children 
      revealed cortical dysplasia and a single nucleotide polymorphism mutation of this 
      gene. The present case is that of a related but geographically distant proband 
      with a similar phenotype but a single-base-pair deletion in the CNTNAP2 gene. 
      This patient exhibited the additional features of periventricular leukomalacia 
      and hepatomegaly.
