TI  - The global, regional, and national burden attributable to low bone mineral 
      density, 1990-2020: an analysis of a modifiable risk factor from the Global 
      Burden of Disease Study 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fractures related to osteoporosis and low bone mineral density lead 
      to substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost to individuals and health systems. 
      Here we present the most up-to-date global, regional, and national estimates of 
      the contribution of low bone mineral density to the burden of fractures from 
      falls and additional categories of injuries from the Global Burden of Diseases, 
      Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. METHODS: The burden of low bone 
      mineral density was estimated from 1990 to 2020 in terms of years lived with 
      disability (YLDs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and deaths, for 
      individuals aged 40 years and older, using data from population-based studies 
      from 48 countries or territories (169 unique sources). Mean standardised femoral 
      neck bone mineral density values were estimated by GBD location, age, and sex by 
      meta-regression. Based on a separate meta-analysis of population-based studies 
      from nine countries (12 unique sources), we also estimated the pooled relative 
      risk of fractures per unit decrease in bone mineral density (g/cm(2)). The 
      population-attributable fraction for low bone mineral density was calculated by 
      comparing the observed distributions of standardised femoral neck bone mineral 
      density to an age-specific and sex-specific counterfactual distribution, defined 
      as the 99th percentile of five rounds of the National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey in the USA, by 5-year age group and sex. Hospital and 
      emergency department data were used to derive the incidence of fractures for six 
      categories of injury (road injuries, other transport injuries, falls, 
      non-venomous animal contact, exposure to mechanical forces, and physical 
      interpersonal violence) using ICD codes. Deaths due to fractures were estimated 
      as the proportion of in-hospital deaths due to the specified injury causes for 
      which a fracture (nature of injury code) was more severe than the cause of injury 
      code. YLDs and DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density by cause of injury 
      were also determined according to previous GBD methods. FINDINGS: In 2020, 8·32 
      million (95% UI 5·58-10·84) YLDs, 17·2 million (14·1-20·2) DALYs, and 477 000 
      (411 000-536 000) deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density globally 
      in individuals aged 40 years and older. Between 1990 and 2020, global YLDs, 
      DALYs, and deaths attributable to low bone mineral density increased by 91·8% 
      (88·5-95·1), 89·8% (81·5-99·0), and 127·1% (108·5-144·5), respectively. Over this 
      period, the age-standardised global rates of YLDs, DALYs, and deaths attributable 
      to low bone mineral density showed modest decreases. In 2020, falls accounted for 
      76·2% (95% UI 74·2-78·3) of YLDs, 65·2% (62·9-67·6) of DALYs, and 71·0% 
      (67·4-72·8) of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density, and road injuries 
      largely accounted for the remaining amount: 12·4% (11·1-13·6) of YLDs, 24·6% 
      (22·5-27·1) of DALYs, and 23·1% (21·6-26·2) of deaths. As a proportion of all 
      fall-related burden, low bone mineral density accounted for 26·6% (23·2-28·7) of 
      YLDs, 25·6% (22·1-27·4) of DALYs, and 40·6% (35·4-44·0) of deaths in 2020. Of all 
      road injury-related burden, 12·6% (10·8-13·5) of YLDs, 6·3% (5·4-6·9) of DALYs, 
      and 8·9% (7·6-9·6) of deaths were attributable to low bone mineral density. In 
      men, road injuries accounted for the largest proportion of DALYs attributable to 
      low bone mineral density in those aged 40-59 years and the largest proportion of 
      deaths in those aged 40-64 years. In women, road injuries were the leading cause 
      of DALYs attributable to low bone mineral density in those aged 40-44 years and 
      the leading cause of deaths attributable to low bone mineral density in those 
      aged 40-54 years. In older age groups among both men and women, falls were the 
      leading cause of the burden attributable to low bone mineral density. 
      INTERPRETATION: Low bone mineral density is a crucial modifiable risk factor for 
      fractures, which are an important cause of morbidity and mortality particularly 
      in ageing populations. This analysis highlights low bone mineral density as a 
      cause of health loss not just from falls, but also from road injuries. FUNDING:
