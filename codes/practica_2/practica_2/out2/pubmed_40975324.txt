AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cistanche deserticola Y.C.Ma, revered as "desert 
      ginseng" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, has been historically prescribed for 
      treating five strains and seven injuries, and nourishing the five zang organs. 
      While its total glycosides (GCs) demonstrate hepatoprotective potential against 
      acute alcoholic liver disease (ALD), their efficacy in chronic ALD and mechanism 
      remain unexplored. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the 
      protective effects of GCs against chronic ALD and to elucidate its molecular 
      mechanisms by multi-omics approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chronic ALD mouse 
      model evaluated the therapeutic effects of GCs, with systematic assessment of 
      hepatic pathological features including liver index, liver functions, and 
      oxidative stress, etc. Integrated multi-omics strategies (plasma-targeted 
      metabolomics, bile acid-specific profiling, hepatic transcriptomic) were employed 
      to delineate metabolic reprogramming and identify critical signaling pathways. 
      Mechanistic investigations revealed that GCs attenuated bile salt hydrolase (BSH) 
      activity. The BSH inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) was used as a 
      pharmacological tool for the mechanistic investigation of GCs. The molecular 
      mechanism was validated by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing methods. RESULTS: GCs treatment significantly 
      attenuated ALD pathologies. Plasma-targeted metabolomics and bile acid profiling 
      demonstrated GCs-mediated remodeling of bile acid homeostasis and lipid metabolic 
      networks. Mechanistically, GCs potently inhibited BSH activity, which was 
      validated the pivotal role in ALD pathogenesis by CAPE. Transcriptomic and 
      molecular analyses revealed that GCs subsequently reduced SCD1, and activated 
      AMPK/mTOR signaling, thereby coordinately regulating lipid catabolism, and 
      inflammatory cascades. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the protective 
      effects of GCs against chronic ALD through inhibition of BSH activity to dictate 
      bile acid metabolism, thereby alleviating cholestasis, which subsequently 
      regulate SCD1/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.
