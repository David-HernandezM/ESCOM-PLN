TI  - Progress and challenges in sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxias.
LID - 10.1038/s41582-025-01136-0 [doi]
AB  - Sporadic late-onset cerebellar ataxia (SLOCA) is a syndrome defined by subacute 
      or chronic and progressive ataxia occurring after the age of 40 years in 
      individuals without a family history of ataxia. The 2022 publication of revised 
      consensus diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy and the emergence of 
      promising biomarkers provides a thorough diagnostic framework that now enables 
      the diagnosis of numerous acquired causes of SLOCA, including autoimmune 
      disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The ongoing development and increased 
      availability of DNA sequencing technology have uncovered several molecular causes 
      of SLOCA besides spastic paraplegia type 7 and very late-onset Friedreich ataxia. 
      These additional causes include sporadic genetic disorders, such as 
      spinocerebellar atrophy type 27B, caused by GAA expansion in the FGF14 gene, and 
      cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), 
      caused by biallelic expansions in the RFC1 gene. This Review presents an updated 
      clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of SLOCA that focuses on the 
      most important developments in this field. Future challenges are also discussed, 
      including the identification of additional missing genetic causes of SLOCA, 
      especially via the use of long-read genome sequencing, improvements in SLOCA 
      prognostication and the implementation of clinical trials of neuroprotective 
      interventions.
