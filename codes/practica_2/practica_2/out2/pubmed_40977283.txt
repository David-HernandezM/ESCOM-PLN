TI  - Marine Natural Product Chagosendine C Induces Cuproptosis in Colorectal Cancer 
      Cells by Targeting FDX1.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.5c07917 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is hampered by high recurrence rates and drug 
      resistance. Cuproptosis, a copper-induced cell death mechanism, offers a new 
      therapeutic approach. Here, we identified a marine natural product, chagosendine 
      C (CHC), which kills tumor cells by increasing the intracellular copper ion 
      concentration. CHC and related metal coordination homodimer alkaloids were 
      rapidly synthesized and purified for further pharmacological study. In vitro, CHC 
      significantly inhibited HCT116 and RKO CRC cell growth, induced G1 phase arrest 
      and cell death, and overcame oxaliplatin resistance. In vivo, CHC suppressed 
      colorectal tumor growth in mice at 40 mg/kg without obvious toxic effects. 
      Mechanistically, CHC induces cuproptosis by targeting FDX1, increasing 
      intracellular copper ions and ROS levels in tumor cells, and leading to cell 
      death. Thus, CHC presents a novel CRC treatment strategy, showing strong 
      antitumor activity and potential to overcome oxaliplatin resistance with 
      promising clinical prospects.
