      Discrepancies between mother- and teacher-reported outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is common and has been 
      associated with childhood behavioural problems among offspring, specifically 
      hyperactivity and conduct problems. OBJECTIVE: Assessments of child behaviour in 
      many previous studies have relied on maternal or parent report. Acknowledging 
      that results of behavioural assessments vary between informants, we examined the 
      association between maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy and behaviour 
      problems in childhood based on mother- and teacher-report. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal study of 560 mother-child pairs with data on illnesses and 
      medication use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental assessments during 
      childhood was conducted. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was captured using a 
      standardised maternal interview, completed 1 year after delivery on average. 
      Measures of childhood (6-12 years of age) behaviour were obtained via mother- and 
      teacher-report, using the Child Behaviour Checklist and Teacher Report Form. 
      Linear and log-binomial models were used to calculate adjusted mean differences 
      (MD) and risk ratios (RR), respectively and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
      internalising, externalising, and total behaviour problems comparing 
      acetaminophen users to non-users. Stabilized inverse probability weights were 
      used to account for loss to follow-up, and adjustments for indication were made. 
      RESULTS: Approximately 60% (n = 354) of women reported use of acetaminophen 
      during pregnancy. Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was associated with an 
      increase in total behaviour problem score and risk of clinical behaviour problems 
      according to mother report (MD 2.2, 95% CI 0.3, 4.1 and RR 1.93, 95% CI 0.99, 
      3.76) but not according to teacher report. Weighting to account for participation 
      did not alter results, while adjustment for indications of acetaminophen use 
      greatly attenuated the associations with mother-reported total behaviour problem 
      score and risk of clinical behaviour problems (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.1, 2.3 and RR 
      1.31, 95% CI 0.67, 2.58). CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was 
      weakly associated with mother-reported behaviour problems and not associated with 
      teacher-reported problems.
