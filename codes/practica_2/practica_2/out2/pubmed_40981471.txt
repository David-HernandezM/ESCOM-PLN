TI  - Polyethylene terephthalate microplastics exposure enhances the risk of ulcerative 
      colitis: insights from multi-omics integration, machine learning, and molecular 
      docking reveal intestinal toxicity mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent decades, the widespread use of polyethylene terephthalate 
      (PET) has led to the proliferation of PET microplastics (PET-MPs) in the 
      environment, posing potential threats to human health, including ulcerative 
      colitis (UC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. 
      METHODS: Data sourced from public databases were harnessed to predict the targets 
      of PET-MPs and identify UC-related differentially expressed genes. Functional 
      enrichment analyses were conducted to uncover relevant biological pathways. Three 
      machine learning algorithms were utilized to screen for hub genes associated with 
      PET-MPs-induced UC, followed by the evaluation of these hub genes using eight 
      machine learning algorithms via SHAP analysis. Subsequently, a nomogram was 
      constructed and validated based on a Risk prediction model, and single-cell 
      sequencing analysis and molecular docking were performed. An animal model was 
      established via co-administration of 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and PET-MPs. 
      Western blot analysis was employed to verify the protein expression levels in 
      intestinal tissues. RESULTS: Eleven potential targets related to PET-MPs-induced 
      UC toxicity were identified. Four hub genes (CTSK, NAAA, PDE4B, and PFKFB3) were 
      successfully screened out, exhibiting significant expression disparities in UC 
      samples. The constructed Risk prediction model demonstrated high prediction 
      accuracy. Single-cell analysis revealed distinct expression patterns of the hub 
      genes across different cell types, and molecular docking confirmed strong binding 
      affinities between PET-MPs and these genes. Animal experiments revealed that the 
      expression levels of CTSK, PDE4B, and PFKFB3 in the DSS + PET-MPs group were 
      significantly upregulated, while the expression level of NAAA was significantly 
      downregulated, compared with the DSS group. CONCLUSION: This study offers 
      valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which PET-MPs may induce UC, 
      providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the potential health risks 
      associated with PET-MPs exposure.
