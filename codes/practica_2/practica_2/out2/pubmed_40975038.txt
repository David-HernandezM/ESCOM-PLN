AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a neurovascular disorder characterized by a 
      prolonged treatment period and a high risk of recurrence. Rutin, a principal 
      flavonol, has demonstrated potential neuroprotective effects in previous studies; 
      however, its regulatory mechanism on neuroinflammation following IS remains 
      incompletely elucidated. PURPOSE: This investigation aims to elucidate the 
      neuroprotective mechanisms of rutin in IS, with a particular focus on the 
      NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway.: METHODS: A dual investigative strategy was 
      employed, combining a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)-induced 
      cerebral ischemia model in vivo with oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation 
      (OGD/R)-treated astrocyte cultures in vitro. These experimental approaches were 
      integrated with network pharmacology prediction and transcriptomic profiling to 
      systematically elucidate the neuroprotective efficacy and multitarget regulatory 
      mechanisms of rutin. RESULTS: Our research demonstrated that rutin significantly 
      reduces infarct volume and improves neurological outcomes in the tMCAO rat model, 
      with the most pronounced effects occurring at a dosage of 80 mg/kg. Network 
      pharmacological research analysis identified 91 putative rutin targets associated 
      with IS, including key inflammatory mediators such as interleukin - 6 (IL-6), 
      tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β. After rutin intervention, the levels 
      of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) p65, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain 
      associated protein 3 (NLRP3), Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-α were 
      significantly reduced, while Gastermin D (GMDSD) was increased in tMCAO rats. In 
      the OGD/R model, rutin inhibited the activation of NLRP3, and further enhanced 
      the inhibition of NF-κB in combination with JSH-23. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      delineates a multimodal neuroprotective efficacy of rutin in IS, mechanistically 
      characterized by its coordinated suppression of the neuroinflammation-pyroptosis 
      axis via NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway modulation. The dose-dependent attenuation of 
      astrocytic homeostasis disruption further substantiates its therapeutic 
      precision, consistent with the multitarget engagement patterns predicted by 
      network pharmacology. Notably, functional validation with an NLRP3 agonist 
      highlights pathway specificity, positioning rutin as a promising phytochemical 
      scaffold for the development of neurovascular unit-stabilizing agents. These 
      findings not only broaden the pharmacodynamic paradigm of flavonoid-based stroke 
      therapeutics but also advocate for systematic exploration of rutin's 
      translational potential in modulating neuroinflammatory cascades across 
      neurological disorders.
