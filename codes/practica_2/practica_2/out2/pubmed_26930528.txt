TI  - Use of acetaminophen (paracetamol) during pregnancy and the risk of autism 
      spectrum disorder in the offspring.

AB  - Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is available over the counter in most countries and 
      is widely considered to be safe for use during pregnancy; studies report 
      gestational exposures to acetaminophen that lie in the 46%-65% range. 
      Acetaminophen influences inflammatory and immunologic mechanisms and may 
      predispose to oxidative stress; these and other effects are hypothesized to have 
      the potential to compromise neurodevelopment in the fetal and infant brain. Two 
      ecological studies suggested that population-level trends in the use of 
      acetaminophen were associated with trends in the incidence/prevalence of autism; 
      one of these studies specifically examined acetaminophen use during pregnancy. 
      One large prospective observational cohort study found that gestational exposure 
      to acetaminophen (especially when the duration of exposure was 28 days or more) 
      was associated with motor milestone delay, gross and fine motor impairments, 
      communication impairment, impairments in internalizing and externalizing 
      behaviors, and hyperactivity, all at age 3 years; however, social and emotional 
      developmental behaviors were mostly unaffected. A very recent large cohort study 
      with a 12.7-year follow-up found that gestational exposure to acetaminophen was 
      associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder, but only when a 
      hyperkinetic disorder was also present. In the light of existing data associating 
      acetaminophen use during pregnancy and subsequent risk of 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, this new finding suggests that the 
      predisposition, if any, is toward the hyperkinetic syndrome rather than to 
      autism. In summary, the empirical data are very limited, but whatever empirical 
      data exist do not support the suggestion that the use of acetaminophen during 
      pregnancy increases the risk of autism in the offspring.
