AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy with poor prognosis 
      due to relapse and chemotherapy resistance. FLT3 mutations promote AML and 
      predict adverse outcomes. As most AML cells express FLT3, it represents a 
      promising therapeutic target. In this study, we develop FL-Fc-DM1, a 
      FLT3-targeted conjugate linking FLT3 ligand-Fc to DM1. FL-Fc-DM1 demonstrates 
      potent anti-leukemic activity in vitro, ex vivo, and in both cell line- and 
      patient-derived xenograft models. Notably, it effectively targets 
      cytarabine-resistant AML cells by promoting cell cycle entry and inducing 
      apoptosis. FL-Fc-DM1 also significantly reduces functional leukemia stem cell 
      frequency, as demonstrated by limiting dilution transplantation assays. The 
      therapeutic efficacy can be further strengthened by BH3 mimetics. Importantly, 
      toxicity assessments in a humanized mouse model show limited impact on normal 
      human hematopoiesis at therapeutic doses. Our findings suggest that FL-Fc-DM1 is 
      a promising candidate for AML treatment, even for cell cycle-arrested or 
      slow-cycling chemo-resistant AML cells.
