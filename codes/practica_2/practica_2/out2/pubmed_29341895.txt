AB  - BACKGROUND: The non-prescription medication paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is 
      currently recommended as a safe pain and fever treatment during pregnancy. 
      However, recent studies suggest a possible association between APAP use in 
      pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a review of 
      publications reporting associations between prenatal APAP use and offspring 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes. METHODS: Relevant sources were identified through a 
      key word search of multiple databases (Medline, CINAHL, OVID and TOXNET) in 
      September 2016. All English language observational studies of pregnancy APAP and 
      three classes of neurodevelopmental outcomes (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligence quotient (IQ)) 
      were included. One reviewer (AZB) independently screened all titles and 
      abstracts, extracted and analyzed the data. RESULTS: 64 studies were retrieved 
      and 55 were ineligible. Nine prospective cohort studies fulfilled all inclusion 
      criteria. Data pooling was not appropriate due to heterogeneity in outcomes. All 
      included studies suggested an association between prenatal APAP exposure and the 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes; ADHD, ASD, or lower IQ. Longer duration of APAP use 
      was associated with increased risk. Associations were strongest for hyperactivity 
      and attention-related outcomes. Little modification of associations by indication 
      for use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these nine studies suggest an 
      increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes following prenatal APAP 
      exposure. Further studies are urgently needed with; precise indication of use and 
      exposure assessment of use both in utero and in early life. Given the current 
      findings, pregnant women should be cautioned against indiscriminate use of APAP. 
      These results have substantial public health implications.
