TI  - Diseases Transmitted by Man's Worst Friend: the Rat.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.IOL5-0015-2015 [doi]
AB  - Historically, the rat has been considered a scourge to mankind, for example, rats 
      infected with the plague bacillus that caused the Black Death, which accounted 
      for millions of deaths in Europe during the Middle Ages. At least three pandemics 
      (in the 5th and 6th, 8th through 14th, and 19th through 21st centuries) of plague 
      ravaged civilizations, and the disease undoubtedly plagued humankind prior to 
      recorded history. Also, numerous other diseases are spread to humans by rats; 
      thus, a quote from Hans Zinsser's text Rats, Lice, and History, "Man and rat will 
      always be pitted against each other as implacable enemies," conveys the general 
      revulsion that society holds for the wild rat.
