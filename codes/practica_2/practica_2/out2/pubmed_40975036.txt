AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia (HUA) has become a bothersome health problem that 
      cannot be ignored. An increasing number of patients with HUA seek Chinese herbal 
      medicine (CHM) as an alternative or complementary treatment. However, there was a 
      lack of real-world evidence on the long-term impact of CHM in HUA populations. 
      PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the clinical outcomes and safety of CHM 
      among individuals with HUA in mainland China. STUDY DESIGN: A population-based, 
      active-comparator new-user designed cohort study of patients with HUA was 
      performed using the Yinzhou Regional Health Care Database (YRHCD). METHODS: A cox 
      model with propensity score matching was applied to estimate the hazard ratio 
      (HR) of the association between the use of CHM and gouty arthritis (GA). Various 
      subgroup analyses and multiple sensitivity analyses were also performed to 
      demonstrate the robustness of results. The secondary outcomes were drug-induced 
      liver injury (DILI) risk and gouty nephropathy (GN) risk. RESULTS: A total of 40 
      653 patients with HUA were included from the YRHCD between 2015 and 2024, among 
      whom 35 511 participants were CHM users and 5 142 were benzbromarone (BBR) users. 
      In the primary analysis, the incidence of GA was 34.43 per 1 000 person-years for 
      CHM users and 58.00 per 1 000 person-years for BRR users, respectively. CHM users 
      appeared to have a 43 % reduction in risk of developing GA compared with BBR 
      users with an HR of 0.57 [95 %CI 0.50, 0.65]. In addition, there was comparable 
      safety in DILI between CHM users and BBR users (HR 1.18 [95 % CI 0.93, 1.49]). 
      The results were generally consistent in various subgroup analyses and 
      sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: CHM users improved clinical outcomes in 
      patients with HUA and was safe, which can be a promising complementary therapy 
      for HUA patients.
