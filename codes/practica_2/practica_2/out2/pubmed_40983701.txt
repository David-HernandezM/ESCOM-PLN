TI  - Oxaloacetate sensing promotes innate immune antiviral defence against influenza 
      virus infection.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-025-02107-3 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic pathways determine cellular fate and function; however, the exact roles 
      of metabolites in host defence against influenza virus remain undefined. Here we 
      employed pharmacological inhibition and metabolomics analysis to show that the 
      metabolic pathways of oxaloacetate (OAA) are integrated with antiviral responses 
      to influenza virus. Cytosolic malate dehydrogenase 1 senses intracellular OAA to 
      undergo dimerization and functions as a scaffold to recruit the transcription 
      factor ETS2 for phosphorylation by the kinase TAOK1 at serine 313. The 
      phosphorylated ETS2 translocates into the nucleus and supports optimal expression 
      of TBK1, an indispensable activator of type I interferon responses. OAA 
      supplementation provides a broad-spectrum antiviral ability, and OAA deficiency 
      caused by Acly genetic ablation decreases antiviral immunity and renders mice 
      more susceptible to lethal H1N1 virus infection. Our results uncover a signalling 
      pathway through cellular OAA sensing that links metabolism and innate immunity to 
      coordinate defence against viral challenge.
