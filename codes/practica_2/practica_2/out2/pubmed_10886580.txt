TI  - Calculated nitrogen balance in hemodialysis patients: influence of protein 
      intake.
PG  - 336-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal nutrient intake is important in the maintenance of a positive 
      nitrogen balance in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The objectives of this study were 
      (1) to assess the influence of two levels of protein intakes on nitrogen balance 
      in stable adult HD patients, and (2) to identify a minimum level of protein 
      intake that would result in a negative nitrogen balance, so that preliminary 
      recommendations may be made in Indian patients on maintenance HD (MHD). METHODS: 
      Stable, adult, nondiabetic MHD patients were recruited after informed consent 
      into a cross over trial with a high-protein (HP) diet [1.2 g/kg ideal body weight 
      (IBW)/day), followed by a low-protein (LP) diet (0.6 g/kg IBW/day] after 
      appropriate periods of equilibration; for both diets, 50% of protein was of high 
      biological value, and calorie intake was 35 kCal/kg IBW/day. Duplicate meals and 
      residues were weighed, homogenized, and stored at -20 degrees C for analysis of 
      dietary N by the Kjeldahl method, used to check the consistency of the N content 
      of the diet supplied. Pre- and post- (30-minute equilibrated) blood urea samples 
      were drawn, and details of weights and other HD parameters were recorded. 
      Interdialytic urine collections for urea were obtained. N input came from dietary 
      protein calculated as 16% of the weight of biological protein; N output was 
      calculated using blood-side urea measurements and urinary urea excretion and was 
      the sum of urea N (UN) and nonurea N (NUN) losses (assumed to be equal to 0.031 g 
      N/kg/day). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were recruited. Twelve patients completed 
      both limbs of the study. The mean age was 30.3 +/- 12.7 years. The body mass 
      index was 18.9 +/- 2.4. Serum albumin was 3.8 +/- 0.35 g/dL, and Kt/V 
      (equilibrated) was 1.17 +/- 0.3 g/dL. Protein consumed was 1.06 +/- 0.18 g/kg 
      IBW/day in the HP limb versus 0.61 +/- 0.1 g/kg IBW/day in the LP limb (P = 
      0.000). Energy intake was 33 +/- 6.5 vs. 32.8 +/- 6. 7 kCal/kg IBW/day, 
      respectively (P = 0.8). The normalized protein N appearance (nPNA) was 0.88 +/- 
      0.2 g/kg/day in the HP limb versus 0. 78 +/- 0.2 g/kg/day in the LP limb (P = 
      0.02). Dietary N was 73.5 +/- 15.3 g in the HP week and 42.5 +/- 7.5 g in the LP 
      week (P = 0. 000). The difference between this and the sum of (UN + NUN) losses 
      over the week was 29 +/- 13.2 g versus 1.2 +/- 8.1 g, respectively (P = 0.001), 
      showing a strong, uniformly positive nitrogen balance with HP diet and neutral to 
      negative nitrogen balance with LP diet. The ratio of dietary protein intake (DPI) 
      to nPNA was significantly lower (anabolic) in the HP limb (0.7 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.12 
      +/- 0.3, P = 0. 000). On a scatter plot of nPNA to DPI, a catabolic relationship 
      was demonstrated below a DPI of 0.75 g/kg/day (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.85 g/kg/day). 
      CONCLUSION: A DPI of approximately 1.1 g/kg/day produces a positive nitrogen 
      balance and 0.6 g/kg/day a neutral to negative nitrogen balance, demonstrating 
      protein anabolism as a function of protein intake. It is suggested that a protein 
      intake of 0.85 g/kg/day should be considered unsafe. These conclusions apply in 
      stable nondiabetic adult HD patients in the setting of adequate dialysis and 
      adequate calorie intake.
