TI  - Fructose and glucose from sugary drinks enhance colorectal cancer metastasis via 
      SORD.

AB  - The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), which contain high levels of 
      fructose and glucose, has been causally and mechanistically linked to an 
      increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the effects of SSB 
      consumption on advanced stages of disease progression, including metastasis, 
      remain poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of CRC cells to a glucose 
      and fructose formulation-reflecting the composition of both high-fructose corn 
      syrup and sucrose found in SSBs-enhances cellular motility and metastatic 
      potential compared to glucose alone. Given that CRC cells grow poorly in fructose 
      alone, and cells in vivo are not physiologically exposed to fructose without 
      glucose, we excluded the fructose-only condition from our studies unless needed 
      as a control. Mechanistically, the combination of glucose and fructose elevates 
      the NAD⁺/NADH ratio by activation of the reverse reaction of sorbitol 
      dehydrogenase in the polyol pathway. This redox shift relieves NAD⁺ limitations 
      and accelerates glycolytic activity, which in turn fuels activation of the 
      mevalonate pathway, ultimately promoting CRC cell motility and metastasis. Our 
      findings highlight the detrimental impact of SSBs on CRC progression and suggest 
      potential dietary and therapeutic strategies to mitigate metastasis in patients 
      with CRC.
