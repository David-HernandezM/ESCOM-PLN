AB  - Epoxy fatty acids (EpFAs), including arachidonic acid (AA)-derived 
      epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), are endogenously produced bioactive signaling 
      molecules with diverse physiological effects, including vasodilation, 
      anti-inflammation, and cardioprotection. EETs are generated by a subset of 
      cytochromes P450 and their biological activity is reduced by hydrolysis to 
      dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by epoxide hydrolases. Inhibition of 
      soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) has shown significant therapeutic promise in 
      preclinical models of disease. Despite the profound physiological impact of EETs 
      and the therapeutic potential of sEH inhibitors, the precise signaling mechanisms 
      by which EETs elicit their biological effects remain unknown. Many have sought to 
      identity a high-affinity, EET-activated, G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). This 
      review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the evidence supporting the 
      existence of one or more EET-GPCRs and weighs this evidence against alternative 
      or complementary EET signaling pathways. The breadth of these studies highlights 
      the complexities and challenges in fully elucidating the precise molecular 
      mechanisms of EET actions.
