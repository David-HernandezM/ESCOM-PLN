AB  - CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ), a key transcription factor, plays a 
      central role in regulating inflammasome signaling in neurodegenerative diseases 
      (NDs). This review synthesizes the mechanisms by which C/EBPβ modulates 
      neuroinflammation and its potential as a therapeutic target. We conducted a 
      comprehensive systematic review spanning January 1995 to June 2025, 
      systematically querying Google Scholar and PubMed with the following keywords: 
      neuroinflammation, inflammasome activation, C/EBPβ, therapeutic targeting, and 
      neurodegenerative diseases. C/EBPβ exists in three isoforms-LAP1, LAP2, and 
      LIP-each with distinct functions in inflammasome activation. In Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD), C/EBPβ drives tau cleavage and Aβ pathology through the AEP axis 
      and exacerbates neuroinflammation by upregulating APOE4. In Parkinson's disease 
      (PD), C/EBPβ silencing reduces α-synuclein aggregation and dopaminergic neuron 
      loss by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome. In Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
      (ALS), C/EBPβ is hypothesized to contribute to TDP-43-associated inflammasome 
      activation, though this requires further validation. In Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
      C/EBPβ may influence microglial activation and neuroinflammation, as shown in 
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models. Modulators of the 
      C/EBPβ-inflammasome axis include endogenous regulators like gut-derived 
      metabolites and pharmacological interventions such as small-molecule inhibitors. 
      Therapeutic strategies targeting C/EBPβ hold promise for mitigating 
      neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, though challenges remain in achieving 
      isoform-specific targeting and blood-brain barrier penetration. Future directions 
      include CRISPR-based editing and biomarker development for personalized 
      therapies.
