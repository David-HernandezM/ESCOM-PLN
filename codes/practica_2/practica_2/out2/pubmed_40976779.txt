AB  - INTRODUCTION: Caregivers' decisions significantly influence Alzheimer's disease 
      progression, yet research on the benefits of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) from 
      their perspective is limited. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included 345 
      informal caregivers of lecanemab-treated patients. We collected online 
      questionnaires from 37 tertiary hospitals across 31 provinces/autonomous 
      regions/municipalities in China (2024/06/24 ∼ 2024/12/24). RESULTS: Approximately 
      94.5% of the caregivers opined that the burden of care did not intensify 
      (including remaining constant or being alleviated) subsequent to the 
      administration of lecanemab, among which 25.8% of the caregivers stated that the 
      burden of care was mitigated. Those caregivers with a higher annual family income 
      (≥¥400,000, p < 0.01) and filial caregivers exhibited greater confidence in the 
      therapeutic efficacy of lecanemab. DISCUSSION: Most caregivers hold a positive 
      attitude toward lecanemab, particularly filial caregivers. The application of 
      lecanemab may alleviate the care burden on caregivers. HIGHLIGHTS: We conducted 
      the first China national survey on Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregiver 
      decision-making and lecanemab experience, collecting 345 questionnaires. The 
      majority of caregivers in China hold a favorable attitude toward lecanemab. 
      Higher education, younger age, and filial relationships are associated with 
      reduced caregiver burden. Higher income is linked to increased caregiver 
      confidence and better lecanemab adherence. There is a low adoption rate of 
      blood-based AD biomarkers in caregiver decisions.
