TI  - Association among basal serum BDNF, cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular 
      disease risk factors in untrained healthy Korean men.

AB  - Evidence suggests that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (serum BDNF) can 
      be affected by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), but this relationship is far from 
      clear. Recent reports show an inverse relationship between serum BDNF and CRF in 
      healthy individuals, and other studies suggest a possible association between 
      serum BDNF and cardiovascular disease. However, the possible interaction between 
      serum BDNF, CRF, and cardiovascular disease risk has not been studied. The 
      purpose of this study was to examine the association among serum BDNF, CRF, and 
      cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy men. The investigation involved a 
      large sample of men (n = 995, age range: 20-76 years) who live in the central 
      area of South Korea and were recruited into the Preventive Health Study. Our 
      study showed a significant inverse relationship between serum BDNF and relative 
      VO(2)max (r = -0.412, p < 0.0001) and heart rate reserve (r = -0.194, p < 
      0.0001). Serum BDNF was positively correlated with body mass index (r = 0.80, p < 
      0.0001), total cholesterol (r = 0.185, p < 0.0001), and triglyceride (r = 0.320, 
      p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that serum BDNF may be associated with effects of 
      increased CRF on cardiovascular disease. However, more research is clearly needed 
      before a determination of whether, and to what extent, serum BDNF may be 
      responsible for some of the health benefits associated with CRF.
