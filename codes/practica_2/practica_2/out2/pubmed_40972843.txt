AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combination therapy has 
      demonstrated high objective response rates in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and might improve clinical outcome as neoadjuvant or 
      perioperative therapy. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab 
      plus ipilimumab in patients with potentially resectable HCC and explored 
      predictive biomarkers of treatment response. METHODS: Eligible patients received 
      nivolumab (3 mg/kg) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks. Tumor response was 
      assessed after two and four treatment cycles. Patients then proceeded to curative 
      surgery or alternative treatments according to clinical guidelines. Serial tumor 
      and peripheral blood samples were collected for genomic and transcriptomic 
      analyses and immune cell profiling. RESULTS: Among the 43 enrolled patients 
      (men/women: 37/6; viral/non-viral 41/2; Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 
      A/B/C: 4/13/26; median tumor size: 8.7 cm), 24 underwent surgery, and eight 
      achieved a major pathological response (>90% tumor necrosis). The estimated 
      4-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 44% (95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 28-59%) and 60% (95% CI, 42-74%), respectively. 
      Increased interferon-γ and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) signatures in 
      resected tumors were associated with objective response. In a mouse liver cancer 
      model, B cell depletion abolished the efficacy of anti-programmed death-1 plus 
      anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy, supporting the 
      mechanistic role of TLS. Peripheral blood T cell activation and exhaustion at 
      baseline and post-immunotherapy, assessed using spectral flow cytometry and deep 
      learning algorithms, correlated with response and survival. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neoadjuvant nivolumab plus ipilimumab followed by surgery is feasible and might 
      improve long-term survival in patients with potentially resectable HCC. 
      Immunotherapy-induced TLS formation is associated with enhanced antitumor 
      immunity. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT03510871.
