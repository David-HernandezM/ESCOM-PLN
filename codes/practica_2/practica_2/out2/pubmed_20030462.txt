TI  - Did acetaminophen provoke the autism epidemic?
PG  - 364-72
AB  - Schultz et al (2008) raised the question whether regression into autism is 
      triggered, not by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, but by acetaminophen 
      (Tylenol) given for its fever and pain. Considerable evidence supports this 
      contention, most notably the exponential rise in the incidence of autism since 
      1980, when acetaminophen began to replace aspirin for infants and young children. 
      The impetus for this shift - a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warning 
      that aspirin was associated with Reye's syndrome - has since been compellingly 
      debunked. If aspirin is not to be feared as a cause of Reyes syndrome, and 
      acetaminophen is to be feared as a cause of autism, can the autism epidemic be 
      reversed by replacing acetaminophen with aspirin or other remedies?
